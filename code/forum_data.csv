"Continuing on, with Ichigo resolving himself to come face-to-face with Oetsu after learning the truth, he.. did get the free trip to soul society once again as mister zanpakuto creator has planned everything all along, with this outcome being a part of his scheme too. And.. well the inevitable happened and Ichigo passed. So this calls for forging a new bankai, right? Though things never actually go this straight whenever Ichigo&rsquo;s involved, as again the truth about Zangetsu gave him one hell of a shock.<br />
<br />
Zangetsu resembling Yhwach and being the source of quincy powers inside Ichigo helped him out all this time, that may be the reason his parting words left such an emotional sentiment on Ichigo. Though that way he got his hands on his brand new zankpakuto, the hollow blade and the quincy blade.. with Number One playing in the background and that insane drip&hellip; Bleach at its fuckinggg finest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also good to see others working in their own way to hone their skills for the next invasion and unsurprisingly they concluded with Uryuu joining the sternritters cliffhanger. Full ED theme in the end too, with improvised visulas. Ticked all boxes for a certified banger in other words.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A more than a decade gap, but this still came out as the best thing this season. Pierrot with all the highs, though now the wait game for the second cour which will be in summer next year. Holy yessss."
"Everybody in the Soul Society is training without their Bankais which is the only way they can prepare. And, it&#039;s finally time for Ichigo&#039;s Zampakuto to be forged once again. We also met Zangetsu again or did we? <br />
<br />
And, at last, Ichigo has gotten his new Zanpakuto which looked so fucking cool. That was such a hype moment in the episode and also Uryu went to Yhwach. Can&#039;t wait for the next cour. We also got the full ED song.<br />
<br />
[b]The Blade is ME. Bleach will be back in the Summer of next year.[/b]"
"Very appropriate they saved the #1 theme song for the season finale. Seriously, Zangetsu is still a badass after all these years and looks like Ichigo helped in his unique ways.<br />
<br />
What a finale. It wasn&#039;t a big battle but way for Ichigo to find himself again as a Shinigami this season since his most recent defeat. Next part should be fairly interesting and I really hope they can keep up the technical quality like they did for this season. 8/10. THE BLADE IS ME.<br />
"
"Special ED for 1 hour finale.<br />
[yt]3iptnJEg1kI[/yt]"
"[color=#202124][font=&quot;Roboto, Arial, sans-serif&quot;]And that brings an end to the special hour program as well as the first cour of the TYBW, July 2023 can&#039;t honestly come quickly enough! I&#039;m glad they&#039;re taking the time, because if it&#039;s quality like this, I doubt there&#039;s anyone sane enough to complain.[/font][/color]<br />
<br />
[color=#202124][font=&quot;Roboto, Arial, sans-serif&quot;]Ichigo got his Zanpakuto after finding out the truth of his origin, and that scene did not disappoint at all. I totally forgot how the old man version of Zanpakuto looked and it just hit me when they revealed it. So he&#039;d been using his hollowfication and Quincy powers all this time, that&#039;s some drop of info. It was funny seeing Nimaiya-san&#039;s team in action with that goofy music in the background, they&#039;ve nailed these moments in the adaption so far.&nbsp;[/font][/color]<br />
<br />
[color=#202124][font=&quot;Roboto, Arial, sans-serif&quot;]Nice to see the other Captains trying to figure out a way to contribute despite losing their bankai. In the end, they&#039;ll need everything they can get, one would feel. Uryu over to the Quincy side though, as if there wasn&#039;t enough of a threat to begin with xD.[/font][/color]<br />
<br />
[color=#202124][font=&quot;Roboto, Arial, sans-serif&quot;]Pertaining to last episode, it was nice to see the full revelation behind the Isshin-Masaki relationship. I was expecting some more chill moments but oh well, got to make the most of the limited time they&#039;ve got, ig. Urahara-san remains a mystery, but credits to him for saving the day in the first half of the episode. It&#039;s sad how Ywach-san operates, stealing powers from his bloodline, but that was to be expected given his behaviour this cour I suppose.&nbsp;[/font][/color]<br />
<br />
[color=#202124][font=&quot;Roboto, Arial, sans-serif&quot;]Updated visuals for the ED, that was a pretty nice little change. I was anticipating some sort of news from Twitter and all of a sudden noticed some kind of fanservice, always glad to see stuff like that.&nbsp;[/font][/color]<br />

"AOTY for me with Summertime Render being a close 2nd.<br />
The wait was really worth it. Sadly we will need to wait again a couple more times.<br />
10/10 My teenager self is more than pleased."
"I still can&#039;t believe how good this season has been.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I watched it out of curiosity since I had a soft spot for Bleach (being my favorite of the old big 3), but damn, this was actually incredible almost all the way through, with the only weak link being Episode 8 - Shooting Star Mix (also still a bit sad about lack of Rukia peach). The Fire, Born in the Dark and Blade is Me were absolutely phenomenal episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall, what has been adapted so far has been much better than the manga counterpart. See you guys in July for more Bleach kino and enjoy the new Year, bros/sisters.<br />
<br />
9.5/10."
"Ichigo is dual sword wielding now, lets see his full power seeing that the Quincy blood in him is holding him back for so long<br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/MpLlBPI.png[/img]"
Hands down the best bleach episode ever created. They really did justice to the manga. Perfect 10/10 
"Now that&#039;s how to end a season. Big reveal after big reveal. The reveal that old man Zangetsu was really Yhwach and the reveal that Ichigo&#039;s Quincy powers were vastly suppressing him from the beginning of the series are insane. Now that Ichigo finally has a true zanpakto of his own, and he isn&#039;t suppressed anymore, he may now be the strongest soul reaper alive now, besides perhaps Aizen, Kenpachi Zaraki, and the Zero Division. Though he may indeed be stronger than some of them. The way Ichigo dealt with his old man Zangetsu was quite a touching moment, paced really well compared to other parts of this first cour. The music was pretty well utilized this episode as well, fitting seamlessly into each scene, especially the somber moments.<br />
<br />
Like I pointed out in the previous episode. I am not sure if Uryu knows about how his mother died, but it&#039;s unlikely that he didn&#039;t find out or that his family didn&#039;t tell him. So it&#039;s weird that he would even agree to see Yhwach in the first place, especially garbed in the Quincy cloaks like he is ready to join them. I guess we will see what&#039;s going on there next season.<br />
<br />
Ichigo&#039;s new zanpakto is quite unique looking. It will be cool to see how it&#039;s utilized and how different it is compared to his first zanpakto.<br />
<br />
In regards to this first season of the final arc, it had major pacing issues and surprisingly I think the music was not as magnificent as what I was expecting from Shiro Sagisu. While there were a couple of nice new tracks and the old tracks were remixed and reutilized well enough, I just think I was expecting a little more from the music department. Though that&#039;s a nitpick. The real issue was the pacing and how it affected some episodes. A few episodes had really rushed moments and the whiplash between two halves of some of the episodes could feel quite weird and probably could have been fixed if they let some of the scenes breathe a bit longer. <br />
<br />
I think another part of the problem, and potentially the biggest problem, is just how different the tone is between the original series and this season. Since I rewatched Bleach right before watching this arc, the quick pace and serious dark tone really felt out of place. Though it makes sense considering the nature of the arc, it&#039;s impossible to ignore how different it is from the original series. On a similar note, the art style change and the change of pace similarly affect the viewing experience.<br />
<br />
That being said, judging this arc on its own merits it was still a fantastic watch and it was great seeing the final arc of the manga finally be adapted after all these years waiting. The animation had some great moments to shine, especially in the Yamamoto fight, and the anime had some original scenes expanding on the manga. Additionally, the world building and the character building were some of the best the series has put out so far, while finally putting stakes in the story where important good characters die, which provides some necessary tension in an arc this dark. So while I would say I liked the original series of Bleach more, this season is still an easy 10 out of 10 for me."
"I wasn&#039;t ready for this cour ending already😭 <br />
<br />
10/10 adaptation "
"An excellent ending to the season. The blade within truly expresses the current Ichigo.<br />
It will be interesting to see how his Bankai will turn out.<br />
<br />
... and Uryuu 😣<br />
I knew that was coming but it still hurt. DAMN!"
"Man having Number One kick in there was amazing, see you all in July."
"[quote=GoldenSaltPillar message=68251844]still a bit sad about lack of Rukia peach[/quote]Call about a man of culture. I was also, hoping to see some. Well, overall, the season was PEACH PERFECt."
"The squad captains who lost their bankai are training hard. Hopefully their training will pay off. Zangetsu reveal was nice. Ichigo&#039;s dual zanpakuto scene was epic. The animation was literally fire, specially with number one playing in the background.<br />
<br />
This has been a really good season overall, production was top tier. The action scenes were really well done. Really hyped for upcoming cour. See ya all in summer 2023 and hopefully there won&#039;t be any delay."
"What a finale!!!! Man was this episode good!!! They played the &#039;Number One&#039; OST in this episode!! Let&#039;s goo!!!! That scene was just [b]AWESOME[/b]!!!!<br />
<br />
So we now finally know the complete truth about Ichigo. His past in the previous two episodes and now about his Zanpakuto in this episode. Ngl, I still found it to be a bit confusing especially with things like &quot;I&#039;m Zangetsu&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m not Zangestsu&quot;. But I don&#039;t really care. This episode was fire and I got the gist of it. I loved the part where all the Asauchi just knelt down before Ichigo and Ichigo went on to pick his own sword. And yes he has two swords now. He can dual wield now. My boy&#039;s gotten super powerful with this.<br />
<br />
Overall this was a fantastic arc. I&#039;m hyped for the upcoming one&#039;s cuz the story&#039;s just gonna get better from here!!!!<br />
[b]9/10[/b]<br />
"
"Was great to see how some characters are preparing for the next invasion.<br />
<br />
Out of the forging Zanpakutous, Tsumiko is severely getting the short straw. Have to extract a tooth to use make her part.<br />
<br />
Yhwach was handsome when young, I wonder what made him decide go from a stylish look to a mutton chop turned moustache."
What an episode. They really pulled it off perfectly
"The blade<br />
Is<br />
Me.<br />
Can anything get better than this.... Holly peak fiction"
"Mera being the best girl as always,good taste Ohetsu.Also good for Ichigo to finally make peace with both his Hollow and Quincy counterparts by forging them into zanpakto. Uryu involvement will be a stinger with how close their relationship is. Overall a very solid ending for a cour. And number one for the ED is just the most appropriate song for such an ending.<br />
<br />
P.S Also damn never thought Komamura elder is that big of a doggo"
"I&#039;m a bit ashamed of this but... even though I read the manga a while ago, I still cried when Zangetsu told Ichigo goodbye. This adaptation has blowed my expectations out of the water, thank you studio Pierrot for this 1st cour.<br />
<br />
10/10"
nah this cour was fucking brilliant honestly couldn&#039;t have asked more our decade long wait didn&#039;t go to waste can&#039;t wait for the 2nd cour to arrive 😩
It hits really hard when ichigo&#039;s theme plays in background
"Shouldn&#039;t it rather have been &quot;the blades are me&quot; with the dual wielding<br />
<br />
Had to have number 1 in the background to end the cour off"
"10/10<br />
Ichigo making amends with both his Quincy and Hollow sides and finally accepting them as his own, they handled it so well. This cour was perfect."
"The way they handled Blade and Me and Blade is Me couldn&#039;t have been done any better. The journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance to reach higher heights. The subtle sound effects, using the faintest sounds of wind, the camera perspective moving around slowly, atmospheric abstract color schemes and the spinning particles of Ichigo&#039;s soul reflecting their faces. But man the voice acting hits too. Immersive experience. <br />
The amount of subtext in this season of Bleach is quite impressive, as well.<br />
<br />
Time to rewatch. "
Oh boy...that was awesome. 2nd cour in July! HYPED!
Couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better adaptation of Ichigo and Zangetsu&rsquo;s final encounter. Perfect end to an amazing batch of episode. July can&rsquo;t come fast enough
"[quote=5hadow17 message=68252544]Shouldn&#039;t it rather have been &quot;the blades are me&quot; with the dual wielding<br />
<br />

[spoiler]Depite it functioning as dual blades, it&#039;s actually similiar to how Madarame Ikkaku fights with his sword sheath and his blade. The large blade is actually the sword sheath for the smaller one.[/spoiler]"
"Zangetsu, the real Ichigo&acute;s arm appears!!!! kekeke<br />
<br />
<br />
Great season, short but intensive!!!<br />
<br />
9/10"
"Amazing. The scenery + atmosphere with the sounds and animation, were just insane"
The Asauchi bowing to Ichigo after he found his roots was a cool gesture. Bit it served to make that scene that much more dramatic. Toshiro opting to retrain from the bottom by asking and not demanding really shows his humility. Mashiro&#039;s as goofy as ever. But its nice to see that the captains and LT&#039;s are working hard to retrain themselves. Loved the way the bodyguards were introduced though. Kinda reminds me of the super sentai series. The heart to heart with the personification of his hollow powers though was pretty insightful. Now that Ichigo has his full powers back things will be much different. Overall a pretty solid finale that while balancing out lore also did the same with character expansion as well. Looking forward to seeing the next season next year. 
"Now that he knows the full truth about his lineage and Zangetsu, Ichigo has awakened even greater power. Meanwhile, Uryu has gone to Yhwach&#039;s side. Summer 2023 can&#039;t get here any faster man, I can&#039;t wait.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They handled the massive infodump that we got in this double length finale very well. Who am I kidding, this whole season was handled amazingly. They clearly poured all their heart and soul into this, and I&#039;m so happy Bleach received such a great return after a decade. And most importantly, I&#039;m glad that Kubo gets to fix certain things so that he can tell this story the way he wasn&#039;t able to in the manga. I can&#039;t wait for the next part to see this story continue.&nbsp;"
This episode was just OverPowered from start to end!! I just wanna say one thing Pierrot NAILED it!!!!!!!
"they are rockin&#039; the fuck out of this adaptation, YYAAASSSSS"
"It was a legendary season finale, thank you bleach"
"3.5/5<br />
<br />
Wow, what an episode!! Everything seems to have come full circle, atleast interms of setup and progression. This episode was a pure nostalgia trip with genius writing from Kubo and execution from Perriot<br />
<br />
I was visibly giddy throughout the the episode as the reveals slowly crept in with these poignant direction and animation. The confrontation between Ichigo and his perceived blade was immaculate. His Zanpaktou was Ywch&#039;s essence after all and by the end guided by both his quincy and hollow roots, Ichigo unleashes two new Zanpaktous. THE BLADE IS HIM indeed<br />
<br />
Great Adaptation. Sure, it was sloppy sometimes but Perriot could easily call this their best work so far and most of the community will agree. Next cour in about 6 months so waiting will be a drag but can&#039;t wait for more insanity, hype, match ups next time around!! Until then folks ~~"
"Great finale to an overall great season! Loved how it ended with Number One playing. <br />
And now we wait till July for part 2"
&quot;arigato zangetsu&quot; you cant argue this is not peak fiction
"Ooh.. I really want to see his clan&#039;s technique so hopefully Sajin wins against the Great Elder.<br />
<br />
Ichigo only using a fraction of his power and still beating everybody until now is insane. Uryu going to Yhwach&#039;s side isn&#039;t surprising but damn.<br />
<br />
<br />
[b]Edit:[/b] Question answered. :)"
"Oh man, the soundtrack &quot;Number One&quot; playing was just INCREDIBLE. Man, Zangetsu&#039;s reveal and Ichigo&#039;s dual [font=&quot;Verdana, Arial&quot;]zanpakuto was just fucking crazy. Hands down one of the best episodes and the special ED makes it even better. I can&#039;t wait for the second cour, sadly, its gonna take a few monhts.&nbsp;[/font]"

<br />
Thanks!&nbsp;"
Lmao finally after the reveal i can see that zangetusu looks like Yhwach. IchigO got his true power but Ishida joins the Sternriiters. Have to wait half an year for more hopefully Pierrot keeps up with the quality.
"Best anime ever<br />
cant wait for the rest of episodes"
"Do I need to say anything? I need to talk? Isn&#039;t it obvious that Bleach was the best anime of the year?? Speechless, just thank for being able to witness this moment"
11/10 episode shiro blessed us again with his music
"What an absolutely underwhelming season. Nice art and animation aside, this season didn&rsquo;t add much narratively. It was legitimately just panel for panel the manga outside of the fights. The Uryu parts especially were disappointing. There were even details cut from the manga and they really butchered the Kenpachi segment with awkward structuring which was much better in the manga despite still being lacking. I&rsquo;m sure this is what fans want, but as someone who didn&rsquo;t care for this arc in the manga and got interested in the anime when I heard Kubo was adding things to the anime to flesh it out, I didn&rsquo;t expect the additions to be so paltry."
the end of the episode is fire
i was old man zangets left us
SAME WAHT I JUST SAYED. 
GOAD DAMN WWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I usually dislikeIchigo. This made me most hyped for him I&#039;ve ever been. 10/10.
"Probably the craziest bleach episode created ever,the animation plus this plot is just something else,u should watch this anime 100%"
Every last second was immaculate
Ansioso pra continua&ccedil;&atilde;o.
"Definitely anime of the year and if you don&#039;t think so, you&#039;re wrong<br />
"
Pure kino. 10/10 and king of shounen for sure. What an amazing adaptation. Kubo-sama... I kneel.
"this ended right were most were predicting, however after this its pretty much non stop fighting, wonder where will next season end, i dont think it will have a cool cliffhanger"
simplemente magnifico 
"Masterpiece, thats the only word i can think of!"
The most uninteresting work.
a great finally for this cour the animation and character design is great and now many questionable things are explained. We waited 10 years for this and it was worth waiting 
"Can&#039;t believe that the first season is already over!<br />
<br />
Each episode was a wonderful return to the past, very well made. <br />
<br />
The flashbacks from the past is for me the cherry on top to the season finale. <br />
<br />
Why do we have to wait so long till July for the second season to come out? :D"
"Great season, amazing animation, art style, coloring, all was amazing, ah man what a return for Bleach"
new zanpakto might be the best thing ive ever watched period.
NOW YOU FEEL LIKE NUMBER ONE!!!
"So, what does that mean now that old man Zangetsu is completely gone? No more manifestation of the Quincy power?"
"Number One OST I&#039;ve missed you!!<br />
What great timing to play the OST and a climactic way to end this cour.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be patiently waiting for the next cour!<br />
<br />
All Asauchi kneeling before Ichigo was epic!<br />
Oh, and I think it was pretty clear that old man Zangetsu was Yhwach to anyone who tried contrasting those two.<br />
<br />
5/5!"
"Better than the manga yet still a massively overhyped shounen if we&#039;re being honest. Some episodes blew my expectations as far as what Pierrot could do, others were subpar or just as boring as its drawn counterpart. Also, the sound mixing and soundtracks were hit or miss week to week, same thing for fight choreography even though most of it was an improvement over Kubo&#039;s bland storyboards.<br />
<br />
7/10 for this cour of TYBW."
"insane masterful, greatful for this arc.. enjoyed it a lot"
holy cour 2 is only dropping in July!?!?!? Might end up reading the manga after all...
Lets fckn go!! What a amazing adaptation for cour 1!! Thank you Kubo!! 😭 IchiGoat!! 🔥
tHE GOAT THE GPOTA THE GOAT
What a fitting way to end it off.
"I can&#039;t say anything else other than just saying Cooooooool for this episode and goodbye for this last episode &quot;See you in July&quot;<br />
<br />
Really Cool Episode 1.000.000/10"

Thank you for the clarification!<br />
It certainly makes more sense now, as both episodes combined won&#039;t be longer than 48 mins<br />
<br />
Edit: Just watched TV Tokyo&#039;s. I honestly prefer this combined version, but that&#039;s just a personal preference."
this is a work of art
"I can&acute;t pick the right words for this episode, its impossible. ZANGETSU aaaagggghhhhhh"
"Full of brilliance start to finish and a triumphant return. Simply amazing. <br />

The score and the animation and the story were so great!!
Perfect ending ang gr8 artwork

Kubo started rushing this arc at some point on what they&#039;ll adapt next cour, and he&#039;s basically fixing it by adding everything he wanted to show with the anime"
"After those years i really feel satisfied from that season. It had everything, hype, story, battles, perfect design. Next stop July 2023.<br />
10/10"
"If they played&nbsp;the OST &quot;Nothing Can Be Explained&quot; when Ichigo was talking to Zangetsu, I think this episode would have been perfect."
"im legit fucking crying rn<br />
this 13 episodes were just beautiful<br />
<br />
10/10"
"I thought I could only get so erect.. That is until I watched this episode O.O<br />
<br />
Send help"
Now this is a way to end a cour. The whole episode was so epic especially the revealing of Ichigo&rsquo;s true shikai
This is so so so good. The animation. The story. Ichigo reforging his sword. The asauchi bowing down. Everything is just *chefs kiss* I am an anime only consumer of bleach and this reboot exceeded my expectations infinitely. 
"loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

"Things are bound to get ugly if Aizen is involved. They may have ended without much noise the other day though the reason was he chose to observe rather than jumping straight in between Isshin and Masaki&rsquo;s meetup. But still that wound Masaki received from hollow had the situation go dire, with her soul undergoing hollowfication and already deteriorating bit by bit of her life.Though apparently there&rsquo;s a man who&rsquo;s a certified expert when it comes to curing or at the very least minimizing the repercussions of this kind and indeed he, Urahara Kisuke, played his part this time around as well.<br />
<br />
The special shell which Urahara suggested to Isshin as a means to save Masaki&rsquo;s life, took his shinigami powers out and thus made him someone in-between a shinigami and a human. As a result Masaki was saved but this ended up her getting exiled from the Ishida family. And well we know how things went from that point.. from the birth of Ichigo to him awakening his shinigami as well as hollow powers later down the line and then finally to the death of Masaki.<br />
<br />
The most important part of the flashback&hellip; the truth behind Masaki&rsquo;s death, which was revealed to be the result of Yhwach waking up from his slumber and stealing powers from the mixed-blooded quincies in an attempt to regain his own power. A real unfortunate end, not just for her but for Uryuu&rsquo;s mother, Katagiri too as she just like the former was a mixed-blooded quincy. This now with all certainty made Yhwach as the super bad boss.<br />
<br />
Liked the way they adapted this flashback, giving it that air of seriousness which the situation demanded though the fanservice suffered. Ichigo with the thank you. Lucky we&rsquo;ve the final episode coming just after this one *God bless the one-hour special*[font=Arial]&nbsp;[/font]<br />
"
"Some more scenes on Ichigo&#039;s parents. And, how Ichigo&#039;s mom got affected by that previous encounter. But, she was lucky that Urahara was there to treat her and also Ichigo&#039;s dad. Also, Ichigo&#039;d dad&#039;s Getsuga Tenshou was cool as well. <br />
<br />
It was nice to see Ichigo&#039;s mom and dad being wholesome and super sweet. It was truly touching to see those memories. We also got to see how Ichigo&#039;s mom died. Ichigo is ready now."
"Damn, they really gave a a solid narrative storytellng about Masaki in this. Noy only that but we are also reminded about the mechanics of Hollowfication. I know parts of this episode was more of an info dump but still very important that connects the franchise as a whole.<br />
<br />
[color=#202124][font=&quot;Roboto, arial, sans-serif&quot;][font=&quot;\&quot;Google Sans\&quot;, Roboto-medium, arial, sans-serif-medium, sans-serif&quot;]Kisuke Urahara is still a genius even after all these years to no one&#039;s surprise.&nbsp;[/font][/font][/color]<br />
<br />
"
"Now that mystery of why and how Masaki died, and why Isshin that we knew was a Shinigami since the Arrancar arc, couldn&#039;t save her. <br />
<br />
Both love stories were great.<br />
<br />
Yhwach killed Ichigo&#039;s mother, more reason to kill him, there&#039;s none. "
"and that is how i met your mother and  how you were born Ichigo lol<br />
<br />
damn Yhwach is the grandfather of all Quincies <br />
<br />
"
The fact that Isshin didn&#039;t think twice to save Masaki makes him a legend. Their lovestory was a beautiful one but with a tragic end. Ichigo finally knows the truth and he&#039;s more resolved than he ever was.
Brings the whole show full circle.
"[font=&quot;Verdana, Arial&quot;]So with that Ichigo now knows everything. About his dad, mom and ultimately his whole past. It was a pretty sad backstory. Ichigo is now more determined than ever. He&#039;ll probably go back to the soul society now. Can&#039;t wait to watch the finale!!!&nbsp;[/font]"
"So now we now how all that happened with ichigo mom and his parents.<br />
Yhwach is the father of the quincies and so ichigo is going to him i think, very good episode."
"Ichigo finally learned his origins and now he&#039;s ready to get back into the action!<br />
This flashback was quite good in my opinion, felt bad for my man ryuken<br />
Looks like ichigo will get his zanpakuto reforged, looking forward to it!"
"What a beautiful episode!<br />
[font=&quot;Verdana, Arial&quot;]Masaki clearly now one of the best Bleach women...[/font]"
"Captain kinda just abandoned his squad and gave up pretty much everything, Masaki was worth it I guess"
If that hollow had been recovered then they might have been able to detect Aizen&#039;s future actions before it manifested. Though I get why the quincies isolated themselves to that extend them abandoning even their kin was pretty cold. Using scenes from how the visored came to be in conjunction with Urahara&#039;s explanation was pretty neat. That was one hell of a choice that was presented though. Still when it counted Isshin really stepped up. Though they had the most unusual of relationships it was cute seeing the two gradually bond with each other via the clinic. Though i hated grand fisher since seeing what he did seeing how Masaki died just reinforced that. So Yhwach&#039;s appearance was what robbed her of her power and led to her death back then huh. Less king but more of a OG Quincy though. If Ichigo ever needed another reason to fight this was it. 
"I think what&#039;s most important in this episode is the revelation that Katagiri is Uryuu&#039;s mom, I mean, she&#039;s the maid for Uryuu&#039;s family and there&#039;s nothing wrong with that... BUT, she&#039;s not a pure (Echt) Quincy.<br />
<br />
Since we were introduced to Uryuu&#039;s character, he has been always very proud of his Quincy heritage, and angry at his father for supposedly abandoning his own clan, but the truth is that Uryuu is not even a Echt Quincy in the first place, and he probably shouldn&#039;t even had been born if it was for his father&#039;s family wishes. Like Ichigo, there is much stuff he doesn&#039;t know about his own roots.<br />
<br />

"Peak adaptation. I didn&#039;t expect anything, since i didn&#039;t even read the manga after finishing first season years ago. However this season reminded me why i kept watching bleach all these years and even managed to surpass old series on every possible aspect. I saw Bleach in a completely different light and i love it. Every Monday was a blessing. You can feel that this time pierrot made Bleach TV series it with love. The only wish i have for the next seasons.. is to add more original soundtracks from old season (Treachery, Invasion etc.) and the first opening song.&nbsp;&nbsp;"
Ryuken and Katagiri is my OTP. Truly amazing scene with them in the rain.
"I&rsquo;ve seen some manga vs anime comparisons and whilst the anime does miss out on some parts that are in the manga, I&rsquo;m really happy that Studio Pierrot compensated it by adding anime exclusives scenes for example, the first episode when Ichigo displays his Bankai which was a totally cool as it brought back nostalgia to pretty much every BLEACH fan. I also think they a did a great job with the pacing of the show as nothing feels rushed or too slow. Overall I&rsquo;m really happy about the BLEACH TYBL adaptation and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to cour 2."
"Ryuken was completely shocked that Isshin didn&#039;t hesitate on the decision to save Masaki&#039;s life.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Damn, Yhwach was the cause of Masaki and Katagiri&#039;s death.<br />
"
"Quite the reveal in this episode and biggest one for sure is Yhwach killing Ichigo&#039;s mother and also being the Goat of the Quincies. Flashback was done so well, time for Ichigo to go out."
"Episode which contains a lot of information about Ichigo and Uryuu&#039;s parents. I really like the storyline in this episode.<br />
<br />
Good Episode 5/5"
"Literally the worst episode of the cour due to it being 95% boring exposition. And I said this last week, I hate the focus on Isshin so my opinion of the episode is also influenced by my dislike of Isshin. But even ignoring him, Masaki and Ryuken weren&#039;t much better or any more interesting in this episode than they were before. I&#039;m just relieved that this subplot is finally over."
"This arc makes Uryu&#039;s father so much more interesting than in the original series. And not just him. Ichigo&#039;s parents and Uryu&#039;s parents get some major spotlight, giving them much needed characterization. It also makes the main focal point of the story much more personal. The pacing of this episode was also very nice with some great soundtrack choices to go along with the sad scenes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yhwach being the big baddie all along who killed Ichigo&#039;s mother may be a tad cliched, but it makes complete sense in the narrative and works very well into the drama of this arc. I wonder if Uryu knows that&#039;s how his mother died and how he will take it if he does, since he was shown with the blonde Quincy in the previous episode.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All in all, a great episode setting up the backstory which provides a lot of needed information going forward."
"Hell yeah!<br />
<br />
We finally got the backstory explaining why Ichigo is Shinigami, Hollow, human, and Quincy all together!<br />
<br />
I was waiting for this moment ever since Isshin stopped Aizen when he was saying to Ichigo: &quot;I&#039;ve known about you since you were born. You were special from the moment you were born. That&#039;s because you&#039;re a human and...&quot;<br />
I had my conclusions about it. For the longest time, I thought it was &quot;you&#039;re a human, a shinigami, and hollow.&quot;<br />
I was later spoiled when playing Bleach Brave Souls and came to know that Ichigo is a Quincy as well.<br />
<br />
5/5!<br />
Loved seeing the backstory!"
"Well Masakis story felt underwhelming to me. The concept of hollowfication should&#039;ve added more layers, and reasoning. And there were quite a lot of flashbacks used. "
I hate to do this to ya&#039;lls but i&#039;m the one that impregnated Masaki. ichigo is my failed son. Sorry to let ya&#039;lls down like this. 
"A double episode?! Merry heckin&#039; Christmas to us all.<br />
<br />
Again, Everything But The Rain doesn&#039;t disappoint. I wish I could&#039;ve seen some more slice of life moments with Isshin and Masaki, but it seems like the hype train is going full speed toward the finale."
"Masaki&#039;s death is so tragic. I&#039;m glad she at least managed to find happiness with Isshin after her Hollowfication, thanks to Urahara&#039;s genius."
"That was incredible, love that scene with Isshin and Masaki. The rain scene with Ryuken and Katagiri was also animated beautifully."
"Isshin&#039;s past with Masaki gained new colors here. Katagiri&#039;s loyalty to Ryuken is also worth mentioning. A very insightful episode, with more infos compared to the manga + that scene where Urahara sees Masaki with her friends and feel the odd reiatsu.<br />
<br />
And then Unagi (beautiful I love her a lot ❤) retrieved the Shinigami badge to Ichigo. Time to make things different!"
many are not looking on this ep and only talking about ep 13....but this ep was op too...literally the best explanation and building block....God damn...10/10
"i wonder what the scar of ishida&#039;s dad&#039;s mom&#039;s leg means (world blender but i&#039;m too lazy to look up names)<br />
<br />
i wish they developed the relationship between masaki and ichigo&#039;s dad more than a 1 minute flashback about how they fell in love<br />
<br />
also i wish they explored the consequences of ishin leading his soul society captain role behind. no way no one came after him or investigated/research? It is obvious the first place they&#039;d search is the human town he defeated a unique hollow. "
Finally the true reveal behind all of Ichigo&#039;s different powers. Poor Masaki never really could catch a break in her life. A great flashback to add context to the past and to what will happen in the future.
"isshin&#039;s the goat fir giving his life up at that moment. lowkey heartwarming episode. masaki a W.<br />
<br />
and damn yhwach is the granddaddy of all quincies."
Yhwach is Abraham confirmed.
I love that it focused on ichigo and didn&#039;t break out into a flash back for the episode and was direct with the plot
"Great to have the remaining part of Ichigo&#039;s parents story/explanation for their meeting, that&#039;s why Ichigo&#039;s father is underrated, now I&#039;m curious about the death of the mother of course"
"another amazing ep<br />
I&#039;ve wanted to know about Ichigo&#039;s father backstory since the Aizen arc&nbsp;"
So the guy Ichigo has to beat is the father of all quiches :&#039;(
Well that was depressing
"Even though we&#039;ve never really learned much about Isshin before, it was somehow clear that he wouldn&#039;t mention Masaki in his report to the Captain Commander. <br />
<br />
With Aizen&#039;s involvement, I was aware that the whole thing would have dire consequences. However, with the bite that Masaki suffered from the hollow, I had not expected that a hollowfication would take place directly. However, even Urahara seemed to have sensed this as well when he first met Masaki by chance. After Masaki collapsed in the Ishida&#039;s house, the typical hollow hole appeared. To be honest, I don&#039;t think Ryuuken&#039;s father could have helped Masaki. <br />
<br />
Isshin&#039;s appearance and rescue of Ryuuken as well as Masaki may have been a bit of a coincidence somewhere. However, the same cannot be said of Urahara, since he always appears in the right place at the right time and usually knows what to do. In this case, Urahara was perfectly aware that only he was able to save Masaki. With his presented method, Isshin faced a difficult choice, at least one would have thought so. Like Ichigo, he didn&#039;t even begin to hesitate, which left a deep impression on Ryuuken who hadn&#039;t even remotely expected it. The way Isshin rescued Masaki reminded me a lot on Ichigo rescuing Rukia during her planned execution. What a great reference.<br />
<br />
Poor Ryuuken. He looked and sounded very downcast in his conversation with Katagiri. Without her encouragement he would have given up and possibly even left the Ishida&#039;s house. <br />
<br />
As one could easily see, Isshin had a truly happy time with Masaki, even if it meant giving up his existence as a shinigami. However, what Isshin said afterwards was shocking. Any Quincys that Yhwach judged as impure were stripped of their powers, causing Masaki to be unable to use hers in the fight with Grand Fisher. Likewise, Ishida&#039;s mother Katagiri, who seems to have always been very weak, also passed away. <br />
<br />
What a bittersweet backstory that not only gave us the necessary context to characters like Isshin and Ryuuken which finally made them easier to understand, but also explains Ichigo&#039;s different powers. Isshin couldn&#039;t have picked a better time to tell this story to Ichigo, who had hit rock bottom after being &quot;kicked&quot; out of Soul Society. He&#039;s finally back to normal. Still not sure how he can acquire a Asauchi, but the next episode should hopefully give us the needed answer."
"Excellent episode.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was a little sad. I even felt sorry for Ryuken.<br />
<br />
I guess gigais age. Never thought about until seeing Isshin&#039;s in the flashback."
"So, looking back on it, there&#039;s something I didn&#039;t quite follow (both in the manga and in the anime). Isshin said that Yhwach took the Quincy powers of mixed-blood Quincies because he deemed them unworthy. But Masaki was a pureblood Quincy, so why&#039;d her powers get stolen? The only thing I can come up with is that, by falling victim to the attack by White and (maybe) by having kids with Isshin, she was deemed impure. But that&#039;s just a guess to try and fill in the blanks, as I don&#039;t recall any of that being confirmed anywhere."
the revelation from last episode and twist of the story combine with the design and music is all good!
Being able to watch episodes 12 and 13 was the best Christmas present i&#039;ve been granted in recent years. &lt;3
bro masaki and ishin love story and uryu&#039;s family backstory. Also aizen and urahara in the mix. love it!
Masterpiece amazing perfect awesome TY TITE KUBO!
"[quote=hawk222 message=68256602]So, looking back on it, there&#039;s something I didn&#039;t quite follow (both in the manga and in the anime).

Aizen and Urahara, a true rivalry for the ages."
everything but the rain ... this story is better than half of the romance genre and am happy to see it portrayed this good
Finally we got a true origin of Ichigo&#039;s powers. It was beautyfull &lt;3
best anime of the year !!!  = bleach and next year too
I accidentally watched episode 13 before this oops
"That was a nice narrative of the love story between Masaki and Isshin, the revelation of Ichigo&#039;s roots, and the identity of Uryu&#039;s mother. Ichigo thanking his dad made the episode&#039;s ending on a good standing.<br />
<br />
One thing that made me wonder in this episode was what Kisuke said to Ryuken; that there was another way to save Masaki from Soul Suicide other than what he suggested of linking Isshin to his Gigai and staying with Masaki for the rest of her life. It was a shame that Kisuke cut the discussion short by saying to Ryuken that he had no say/choice on the matter."
"Oh my, even though I already read the manga several times, Masaki-Isshin love story is still very sweet and heartwarming to see....<br />
[img]https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/products/0/0/1/1124857/android/stickers/5098192.png[/img]<br />
Too bad both Masaki and Katagiri had to die, it would be nice seeing them still alive since they all know each other."
well damn. It was Yhwach who ruined everyone&#039;s lives the whole time lmao
"why they gotta remove naked masaki from the manga, she thic"
ICHIGO&#039;S MOM 😍😍😍😍
"Dude they were the cutest couple!! They deserved better <br />
<br />
Damm you Yhwach <br />
<br />
So much information!! And we got two episodes "
"nice romance story<br />
and i guess now that quincy dad is the big villain les go"
"I feel like Urahara&#039;s explanation was a bit less visually intuitive than in the manga, but otherwise a fantastic episode.<br />
<br />
Also, the Light of Ausw&auml;hlen wasn&#039;t shown for Masaki&#039;s death - I wonder if it&#039;ll be an important change or just a stylistic choice."
"[quote=Eifue message=68256776]My guess is that Yhwach idea of impure is anything that isn&#039;t 100% Quincy, since Masaki was a Quicy that was being hollowfied she was no longer a pure Quincy but a mix.[/quote]That&#039;s NEARLY it. Everything should be revealed in time.<br />
"
"This episode is pretty good, this is probably my best episode in this season, the only thing missing here is the old classic Bleach soundtrack which I freaking love, with the old classic soundtrack this episode would hit me in the feels even harder.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a nice season, is it overrated? yes it is, I don&#039;t think it deserves to be in 1st place but then again, I don&#039;t think FMAB deserves it either, I rather have Bleach in 1st place and not that overrated FMAB piece of crap."
I&#039;m so happy finally so of the biggest plot points that bothered me are finally explained.
It was really entertaining and interesting
"Finally after all these years, everything answered.<br />
<br />
In Isshin&rsquo;s case, you&rsquo;re telling me that pretty much all the captains and Rangiku knew about Ichigo&rsquo;s dad all this time? Even when they were at Ichigo&rsquo;s house they just pretended not to know each other?-.-"
"Finally the story of Ichigo&#039;s dad and mum &quot;love&quot; story and hollowfication &quot;origins&quot;.<br />
And how Ichigo&#039;s mum died."
AMAZING EPISODE I LOVE IT BLEACH IS LIFE
"Wow it feels to good get the backstory on Ichigos parents. He really got the genes of soul reaper, quickly, hollows. So crazy to see now after 15 years.  Can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s already last episode of part 1."
What a joy this episode was.
فلاشباك عظيم
"I&#039;m still surprised with the artistic style of this new arc of Bleach, Pierrot is using an interesting and unique technique in the setting in this anime, for example the scene of Ryuken flying with Masaki looks beautiful, the sky even looks real and the effects that they use uffff it is a paradise for my eyes. I liked the chapter, Isshin&#039;s story with Masaki was simpler than I expected but it was good and the scenes of the two of them together that show us how the relationship developed between them were beautiful."
"The goat, peak fiction"
what can i say? they done did it again
Misaki really was awesome :) Perfect adaptation for me as a manga reader 🙌 captured the emotion really well. Let&#039;s see what they do for the finale 😬
"N&atilde;o tem como, melhor anime da temporada disparado.<br />
Muito leal ver toda a hist&oacute;ria de como foi a morte da m&atilde;e do Ichigo..."
Lumayan bgus karena menceritakan masa lalu ibu nya ichigo
"Amazing backstory <br />
I loved it"
This was so cool enjoy watching ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cool to see Ichigo and Ishida&#039;s dads interact with each other. 
Mommy Kurosaki just gorgeous
It was perfect i loved it
It was perfect i loved it
bruh..fans of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood seem to be trying to lower the rating of the anime
"Damn.. this episode is so emotional and sweet.<br />
MASAKI = BEST GRILL"
Yhwach is crazy..
The best ship i ever saw in my life❤️
Keren sangat bagus
PERFECTION THE GOAT
"Animation is much better than the original Bleach anime, but the #1 ranking is ridiculous when you consider that there are only 2 really good episodes and 1 good fight. The story so far has been underwhelming. Don&#039;t get the hype about the &#039;Everything but the rain&#039; arc either."
Mantaaap paraaaah
Very emotional episode with the backstory of Isshin and Masaki 10/10.
Everything but the rain 🌧 😌 
" It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, down to the last minute details"
I will cry like a child that dropped their ice cream when this story is over
"I like how Kubo really gave us some good storytelling on how Ichigo was always a Hollow, Quincy, and Soul Reaper. This all started before he was even born. Madani and Isshin will both be respected for having the courage to sacrifice the lives they knew for each others, as if it were destiny. <br />
<br />
I feel bad for Uryu&rsquo;s father for having to bear witness to the guilt, but stuff happens.<br />
<br />
All of my questions regarding his parents have been answered:<br />
<br />
1. Once we found out about Masaki being a Quincy I was thinking how she could die by the likes of Grand Fisher, but it makes sense that Ywach took her Quincy powers. Sad that she still had to die in front Ichigo.<br />
<br />
2. I always wondered why Isshin never participated in everything at the start of Bleach but he couldn&rsquo;t because he gave up his Soul Reaper Powers.<br />
<br />
Kisuke Uruhara is the goat for coming through to save the day. That man is a genius!"
"Liked the ep., but I wished they added more on Ishida and Masaki&#039;s interaction. Come on, why rush the story so much? It would be so more enjoyable if had more layout since the manga is over and you have the opportunity to tell more. Nevertheless, a fine episode. "
This was truly a masterpiece 
"Qu&eacute;date con quien sacrifique todo, como Isshin para salvar a Masaki. ❤ "
"amazing, as Bleach should be"

"Ichigo&rsquo;s on a home tour though not because he wanted to but was forced, as the time calls for that long overdue flashback about how he came into existence, and about his shinigami father, Isshin. Watching this series for the first time, and always having Isshin doing the shinigami tricks from time-to-time was somewhat confusing as they never ever gave him a concrete background back then, and that&rsquo;s the more reason this flashback stands as one of the most important plot points in the story.<br />
<br />
Isshin being the captain of 10th division shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise given he&rsquo;s the father of our protag, and so is his goody nature of meddling in the matters he shouldn&#039;t have because again.. though that&rsquo;s the very way he met Masaki, Ichigo&rsquo;s to-be mother, a quincy by nature. I mean this again establishes the fact, each and every thing happens according to the will of the man who goes by the name of Aizen Sosuke. Him being in his glasses persona and quoting the ever famous, &ldquo;All according to plan&rdquo;, again owned this episode.<br />
<br />
Anyways there&rsquo;s still things to this flashback, so now to see where they&rsquo;ll conclude this in next week&rsquo;s one-hour special. On a side note, Bleach just never ever disappoints with its women( ͡&deg; ͜ʖ ͡&deg;)"
"It was nice to see Ichigo&#039;s dad and also Ikumi once again in this episode. And, then we saw the backstory of Ichigo&#039;s parents. Nice to see all of them especially Aizen, Gin, and Tosen. The team of GOATS. It was a pretty good episode. <br />
<br />
The best thing about this episode was the way Ichigo&#039;s parents met. It was so cute and wholesome. Also, I loved the fact that Ichigo&#039;s mum was also a badass. Ichigo really inherited their personalities. Can&#039;t wait for next week with that 1-hour combined special episode."
"Ryuuken Ishida is such an overlooked character that seeing him again this season was somewhat of a delightful surprise.<br />
<br />
Episode was definitely interesting imo to show some of Ichigo&#039;s father and his past. Plus, we got to see his history with Masaki! Worth waiting imo and I really hope the 1-hour special next week can deliver."
"Just from this one episode, young Isshin may now be my new favorite captain. His interactions with Toshiro and Rangiku were some of the best moments of the episode, along with his fight with that weird hollow and his introduction to Masaki. He is serious when he needs to be, but very chill and cool the rest of the time. <br />
<br />
After the credits roll, the blonde Quincy who broke Ichigo&#039;s Bankai is shown confronting Uryu. That can&#039;t be good."
Flashback w/ Ichigo dad is finally here &amp; Masaki also! Get to see the past w/ both of them &amp; how Aizen started w/ his manipulations. 10/10 ep!
"I was wondering when they&rsquo;d come for Uryu. <br />
<br />
Can&rsquo;t believe Ichi punked out and ran away. LOL at the look on his face when Isshin came to get him. He looked like a kid that stayed at a party too long. <br />
<br />
Isshin stole Masaki from Uryu&rsquo;s dad. * mind blown * so much is starting to make sense.<br />
<br />
Really good episode. Masaki was strong af."

Don&#039;t call him weird Hollow. Tosen wants you to call him &quot;White&quot;."
"really great ep can&#039;t wait for the next week&#039;s special 😩<br />
also don&#039;t know how i didn&#039;t notice it before but now did considering bleach and blue lock both airing at the same time,i can&#039;t be the only one to think isshin and barou look similar lol?"
"&quot;And that, Ichigo, is how I met your mother.&quot; lol<br />
Loved the scenes with younger Aizen, Gin and Tosen in this. Now we know Masaki wasn&#039;t supposed to marry Isshin but Ryuken (Uryuu&#039;s father) instead, in a form of arranged marriage because they are both Echt Quincies, the &quot;pure blood&quot; ones. Man, what a emotional ride these final episodes are going to be.<br />

"the backstory of the parents of Ichigo so ye Ichigo is a mix of Shinigami, Quincy and Hollow <br />
<br />
mixed race is better than pure blood<br />
<br />
the animation quality drop to average this time though but still has some nice strong still drawings <br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Qgm50QX.png[/img]"
"Ichigo main personality really takes after his mother.<br />
<br />
Masaki is too cool, just with that finisher.<br />
Now we know why Ichigo&#039;s is part Hollow too.<br />
<br />
The excitement in Aizen&#039;s eyes, was of the highest quality. I don&#039;t know if in that moment he gone Hojo, from FFVII"
"Everything but the Rain was, a masterful episode reminiscent of the great Fullbring Arc, the color palettes were great, the overall atmosphere was perfect, the overall pacing was great and the OST was top notch, I&#039;m crying, this is so damn beautiful, I&#039;ve been waiting for this for a long time.<br />
<br />
And to close things up, next week I&#039;ll definitely shed waterfalls, not only because of what&#039;s to come, but because we&#039;ll have to say Good bye to Bleach for a while, and boy, next 3 months are going to be painful without Bleach.<br />
<br />
Really liked the fight choreography as well as Aizen&#039;s involvement with &quot;White&quot;, Isshin is such an underrated Dad and boy, Masaki, you&#039;re still as beautiful since the last time you left.<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t wait for &quot;The Blade is Me&quot;. Also that post credits scene tho.<br />
<br />
we&#039;re up for a very sentimental ending next week."
Masaki and Isshin vs White got me pumped up. Ichigo&#039;s mother had no hesitation tanking White to take it out.
"Blut or not, tanking that bite was badass."
"Ohhh! Really interesting flashback for Ichio&#039;s parents I didn&#039;t even except to see it at some point but worked well, and of course we have the beginning of Aizen&#039;s plans "
"peak fiction peak adaptation no gremmy but still<br />
"
Next week airing late at 24:30 JST + final two eps. back-to-back (1 hour)
"Finally the backstory of how Ichigo&#039;s parents met, it was nice. Ichigo&#039;s mom seems like a lovely girl. Though things won&#039;t most likely end well for them.<br />
<br />
Back to back two episodes next week, looking forward to it."
"It was nice to finally get some backstory for Ichigo&#039;s parents. And it turns out Aizen was telling the truth when he said he knew about Ichigo from the start, it was all part of his plan just like everything else in Bleach."
So that was how ichigo mom and his dad are meeting each other. So she is a quicy what means that for ichigo now im curious.
"Let&#039;s goo!!! The flashback arc is finally here. So Ichigo&#039;s dad was the former captain of the 10th division. It was nice seeing both Toushiro and Rangiku from back then. And yep, we once again see Gin, Aizen and Tosen. Ichigo&#039;s mom&#039;s a quincy and the whole story of how his parents met was both wholesome and awesome. I liked that fight scene!!! There&#039;s still plenty left to tell. I can&#039;t wait to watch the conclusion of this first cour!!!"
"Yes, I&#039;ve been waiting for this! Of course, Kurosaki-san wasn&#039;t going to be fazed at all to meet a Quincy out of the blue, lmao. It&#039;s interesting that the current caretaker of Ishida was involved in the past between them and it&#039;s no surprise to see Aizen and co. as well. And then the drop in the final few seconds of Ishida meeting the general from Wandenreich, things are spicing up for real here!<br />
<br />
Ichigo&#039;s soul searching, it looks like the next two episodes will probably delve more and then proceed to finish things off for the cour. Can&#039;t complain about that, lol. Kurosaki-san&#039;s way of calling Ichigo back home was pretty cool though, I didn&#039;t think he&#039;d want to boast that side of him for long. <br />
<br />
Next week&#039;s going to be insane, and I can&#039;t wait!"
"Thus the Biggest reveal of BLEACH just happened.Ichigo is a half Quincy , half Soul Reaper bit of Hollow , bit of Fullbring , Human. Man is literally the next Soul King. I wad concerned when I found out that Isshin and Tosen have the same voice actor, I knew it will be awkward to see both of them speak in the same episode but they managed somehow. I thought they will be using a new voice actor for Tosen in this episode.I waited whole 1.5 year for this to be adapted in anime (cause I finished reading the manga 1.5 year ago). BEST EPISODE SO FAR."
It was not the best as compared to the other episodes but it feels like a gateway to the next episode and backstories are always cool
"Wow, his mother it was a Quincy!!! kekeke"
"I&#039;m not really a fan of them cutting out some of Aizen&#039;s explanations this episode, but aside from that it was solid"
"And there you have it, the reveal that Ichigo&#039;s mother was a Quincy, thus making Ichigo himself part Quincy. It was great to get more spotlight on Isshin and to see how he and Masaki met. The traitor trio of Aizen, Gin, and Kaname was also a welcome sight (lol I almost forgot Kaname and Isshin have the same VA). The short scene after the ED was eerie, next weeks double length finale is going to be great. I can&#039;t wait but at the same time it&#039;s going to suck to have to part ways with Bleach for a bit. "
how was white created ..we finally get to see it...and aizen sama itself is here..
"The episode was great especially animation, mood and of course the ost was amazing.<br />
Is it me or did they cut some Aizen dialogue about the cloak and about isshin bankai.But these are very minor scene. <br />
Easily the best episode when it come to plot.This episode also gives a good Idea why Aizen known about ichigo the whole time.<br />
Also surprising post credit scene"
In a way the bond between a reaper and their Asauchi is one thats akin to being partners from the beginning. Its nice to see Ikumi again but also Ichigo&#039;s father in full soul reaper fear as well. Hmm so Isshin was the former captain of the 10th huh. Wonder does Rangiku still remember him. It was funny seeing Toshiro as a seated officer back then. Hmm that was a flash from the past of conspiracy of captains led by Aizen. Back then Masaki sure was a bundle of positivity. The prototype Hollow hybrid though sure was terrifying. But Masaki really surprised me during her intervention. Overall a fun ep that did well to balance out Ichigo&#039;s frustration with the reveal of his mothers identity via his parents first meeting. Curious at what happens next. 
"HOLYFUCK<br />
And of course Aizen.<br />
DAMN MASAKI IS OP AF<br />
ISSHIN IS A FIRE USER TOO WHAT"
This episode was fire! How Ichigo becomes the ultimate species.
The best super anime continues at full speed.
"Would be interesting to have seen more of squad 10 in Isshin&#039;s days, with the dynamics between him and Rangiku<br />
<br />
Getting Ichigo&#039;s mother and father to meet and screwing Ryu&#039;s marriage must&#039;ve also been part of Aizen&#039;s plan<br />
<br />
Scenes in the rain looked good, though maybe not at the same level as that fight they did in Akudama Drive"
So let me this get straight no rukia butt... butt we get a lot of misaki thighs? naruhodo 
"I hate backstory episodes by default so this was somewhat unbearable for me to watch. Also Isshin was the featured character and frankly I&#039;ve never liked him much. The animation was gorgeous though, it&#039;s just too bad that the fight was short and the anime didn&#039;t expand it. Would&#039;ve been nice to have seen Isshin&#039;s Bankai, but this series refuses to add interesting non-manga material like that."
bruh the past is legit good
"Isshin&#039;s how I met your mother was actually wholesome and I really like Masaki as a character. Also, we got to see and hear again Gin, pure bliss."
"All according to Aizen&#039;s plan. Even Shiba is part of it in the end. Well, that means Ichigo is quite the mixed guy here, even being a quincy from his mother&#039;s side. The hollow looked like him for some reason, but it&#039;s a failure? Might not be anything big, but the design was similar. A great episode."
"Gin: You do know Tosen is blind. He can&#039;t see what&#039;s on the monitors or push buttons.<br />
Aizen: It&#039;s a joke, just roll with it Gin."
"Watching this episode reminded me that I&#039;ve forgotten way more about Bleach than I actually remember 😅<br />
<br />
The black hollow thing (White), the other guy beside Aizen &amp; Gin, the Quincy family members with Masaki, etc. all familiar but not totally forgot their significance or plot around them.<br />
<br />
Also, that conversation in the beginning with Squad 0 &amp; Renji about Ichigo not being able to get a Zanpakto without having an Asauchi... how was it that he managed to get a Zanpakto in the first place then? Clearly there are other methods to getting one (they even showed Kenpachi simply picking one up off a dead soldier), so why does Ichicgo suddenly have to know his past?"
Omg everything but the rain finally came and this definitely delivered I can&rsquo;t wait for the 1 hour special
Masterpiece of an episode.. the animation and colors used during the night scenes are so beautiful
"AMAZING, loved every second, animation top notch!!"
"How can you not love Misaki? Both on a superficial level and a more deeper one! Like she went and saved her supposed enemy, right?"
Bro it all makes sense now now we know the real reason behind why Aizen was watching over Ichigo it was interesting to him that A Hollow created from a dead Soul Reaper chose a Quincy who was his mom and that&rsquo;s why he watched over Ichigo it was all apart of his plan
Getting a backstory episode is great and having everything connect to Aizen just makes Bleach even better. Maybe Aizen will have a big role for the finale of the show. 
"We&#039;re finally here! I can&#039;t believe it! The Masaki reveal has landed! And Isshin being a Captain and a Shiba,<br />
<br />
Aizen, of course, behind everything... And if it wasn&#039;t for him, we wouldn&#039;t have Ichigo and we wouldn&#039;t have Bleach. So yeah, everything according to his plan."

Isshin can&#039;t use his Bankai if he is seriously wounded, that&#039;s why he couldn&#039;t use it but the explanation was skipped in the anime."
Finally some Isshin screen time lol. Ichigo&#039;s mom looks pretty hot ngl
"Aw, that was a wholesome first meeting between Isshin and Masaki.<br />
<br />
So Ichigo is a Shinigami, Quincy, and a Hollow. What an insane mix. "
FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Ser&aacute; esse o primeiro filler da nova temporada de Bleach???
"great as usual, I just love this season so much, the animation is so great"
"[quote=Softhenic03 message=68203858]Ichigo&rsquo;s on a home tour though not because he wanted to but was forced, as the time calls for that long overdue flashback about how he came into existence, and about his shinigami father, Isshin. Watching this series for the first time, and always having Isshin doing the shinigami tricks from time-to-time was somewhat confusing as they never ever gave him a concrete background back then, and that&rsquo;s the more reason this flashback stands as one of the most important plot points in the story.<br />
<br />
Isshin being the captain of 10th division shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise given he&rsquo;s the father of our protag, and so is his goody nature of meddling in the matters he shouldn&#039;t have because again.. though that&rsquo;s the very way he met Masaki, Ichigo&rsquo;s to-be mother, a quincy by nature. I mean this again establishes the fact, each and every thing happens according to the will of the man who goes by the name of Aizen Sosuke. Him being in his glasses persona and quoting the ever famous, &ldquo;All according to plan&rdquo;, again owned this episode.<br />
<br />
Anyways there&rsquo;s still things to this flashback, so now to see where they&rsquo;ll conclude this in next week&rsquo;s one-hour special. On a side note, Bleach just never ever disappoints with its women( ͡&deg; ͜ʖ ͡&deg;)[/quote]<br />
True,. speaking facts dude."
"God I wish Ikumi was my boss<br />
This flashback was another part I have been looking forward to seeing in the anime for a long time, it&#039;s been great so far<br />
Looks like we get the final two episodes of the cour next week, I bet they&#039;ll be incredible!"
So Aizen claiming he planned Ichigo being born was just that he accidently created the scenario where his parent met? 
"And that&#039;s how your mother and I met.<br />
<br />
<br />
UGHHHH Masaki-san and Isshin-san!!!! They looked really great 🔥 10000/5"
decent mate tbf. misaki is cool
what can i say? i love bleach.
"Motherflippin&#039; Masaki. Oh, this episode was amazing. I really do love Everything But The Rain, more than anything else that happens in this whole arc, so I am a bit biased. But, god damn this episode was great. Best of the season, so far.<br />
<br />
It was great to see all the tie-ins to the previous arcs, getting to really see how Isshin is involved, and why Isshin and Ryuken have the relationship they do.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m looking forward to more Masaki."
so much story i love it.
"i know it was just a small cameo but i enjoyed seeing Gin, Tosen an Unagiya for (i think) one last time"
"Flashback episode about Ichigo&#039;s parents which is very cool, I was very entertained by this episode and also the story in this episode will be the answer to the question who is Ichigo really.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad next week&#039;s last episode is filled with the story of Ichigo&#039;s parents.<br />
<br />
Good Episode 5/5"
The season is almost finished and i feel like i&#039;m left with my pants around my ankles. One of the most addicting animes out there. No doubt about it.
"There were a couple slip ups I could see, but otherwise a MUCH better episode than the previous when it comes to manga faithfulness. White is finally here, as well as a sneak peak at Soul Society&#039;s original sin.<br />
Anime onlys now know how much Ichigo is like his mother, i.e. how much The Black Sun resembles The Sun."
"Reveal of Ichigo&#039;s mother and she&#039;s apparently a quincy. The segment between Isshin vs White was beautiful, the flame animation along with the ost is a top notch"
"Isshin vs White Hollow battle is so good<br />
[img]https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/products/0/0/1/1300447/android/stickers/12151703.png[/img]<br />
I love how Isshin&#039;s shikai is a fire-based, power which only few possess.<br />
<br />
Masaki is so powerful she one-shotted an espada-level hollow, she seems as skillful as Uryuu, being able to rapid fire many arrows at once like that while possessing only basic Quincy bow."
"[quote=CQLLIST message=68207301]Reveal of Ichigo&#039;s mother and she&#039;s apparently a quincy. The segment between Isshin vs White was beautiful, the flame animation along with the ost is a top notch[/quote]<br />
<br />
lots going on but it now raises the question as to how the fuck Masaki died to a low level hollow."
Absolute beauty of a flashback 😭
that! was! awesome! :D 
"insane episode with so many mind-blowing revelations, m just stunned with the visuals and everything in this episode . This season was really good already but this episode just hit another level . Thanks Tite Kubo for this masterpiece and studio Pierrot too."
"the backstory of ishin and masaki is wonderful, aizen master plan as always. good episode!"
"masaki the waifu fam, the backstory of kurosaki&#039;s and ishida&#039;s family and ichigos hollow. And aizen sama plan from the start. demn!"
Ichigo&#039;s origin story is interesting
rly good engaging and entertaning
"The episode was nice but I sure as hell didn&#039;t like the plot armor that Ichigo&#039;s mom had. That crazy Hollow was hell-bent on killing anyone with his weapon thingie, the Hollow 1 shotted the previous guys in 1 move, and instead of 1 shotting Ichigo&#039;s mom with the weapon, he decided to bite her instead, this didn&#039;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t remember this part well in the manga, I don&#039;t know if he bit her to steal her powers or whatever but if the only reason he bit her is due to plot armor and nothing else then that part was shit. Pretty nice episode though.<br />
<br />
I do miss the OST from the old Bleach, it was one of the best soundtracks out there and managed to hit me in the feels a couple of times but the new OST isn&#039;t that good, unfortunately. I need a good OST to really feel it in my veins, if the OST is lack luster then I&#039;m not able to enjoy the moment that much."
"Beautifully adapted from manga<br />
A love letter to all anime fans and a 20 year episode in the making"
Im loving every single one of these episodes fr! Ichigo&#039;s mom is a badass too! Cant wait for the next ep
"[quote=deg message=68204277]the backstory of the parents of Ichigo so ye Ichigo is a mix of Shinigami, Quincy and Hollow <br />
<br />
mixed race is better than pure blood<br />
<br />
the animation quality drop to average this time though but still has some nice strong still drawings <br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Qgm50QX.png[/img][/quote]<br />
The animation quality was top notch and still looked similar so how&rsquo;d it drop in quality?"
Ahhh the plot is peaking
Ichigo&rsquo;s mother is a Quincy? Damn
Fell in love with Masaki. Great episode. Not entirely what I was expecting but actually better.
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
"What &quot;Oh-Etsu&quot; said to Renji at the start of the episode just solidifies the fact that Nimaiya can reforge Ichigo&#039;s Zanpakuto, just not the usual way.<br />
<br />
Isshin and Masaki&#039;s backstory was beautifully done. We got to see White, Gin and Tousen, and of course, Uryuu&#039;s soon to be mother.<br />
<br />
Last but not the least, we saw a somewhat troubled Uryuu, with Haschwalth near him. Obviously we can already guess correctly on what Uryuu&#039;s next move will be, since it&#039;s already spoiled in the OP."
"Every episode of this anime (season) is a banger ohh l&agrave; !!!!!! xD <br />
well bah here we just showed us where the 2nd stage form (hollow like Ulquiorra Schiffer&#039;s) of ichigo comes from !"
"It was an alright episode, not much to say. It&#039;s nice getting to see Isshin and Masaki when they were younger. And Uryuu&#039;s dad whatever his name was..."
awesome episode i loved it
"We finally got to see how Ichigo&#039;s parents met, the episode looked and i loved the color pallets used. Next ep is the last one for this cour"
"AHHH<br />
I CRYED WHEN MASAKI MET ISSHIN.<br />
I DON&#039;T WANT MASAKI TO DIE."
"maan, I could watch an entire movie of Ichigo&#039;s parents&#039; story, such a great chemistry already. If only they could slow the pacing down even just a little :/"
"It was a very beautifully written episode, from start to finish. It told a cohesive story even though the events were occurring in several places at several moments in time. Also the transitions between the scenes were perfect. All in all a completely great episode."
"I wish the fight between Isshin and White was just a little bit more fluid, choreography wise, but other than that the whole episode looked absolutely gorgeous."
just seeing a bit of the past of Ichigo&#039;s father and mother is amazing but a whole episode magnificent.
Peak! Absolutely waiting for continuating Everything But The Rain in 12 and 13 episodes 
"YEEY <br />
ICHIGO MOM SAIKOU &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
aizen is everywhere guys 
"finally this episode i was hoping from so long with the past arc :O <br />
beautiful episode and the one next week will be surely better ^^"
beautifull ishin chad

"As evident from the flashbacks in the last episode, Unohana and Zaraki did share a long history, from the time Unohana used to be a cold-blooded malevolent killer. It was that fight which later had Zaraki inherit the name of Kenpachi, though for now even with the intentions of letting herself be killed in the process of making Zaraki the ultimate fighter, Unohana still went all guns blazing. That long awaited bankai, &ldquo;Minazuki&rdquo;, made its presence in the adaptation after all.<br />
<br />
The dark red solidified ooze in the shape of Katana.. Pierrot nailed that scene to perfection, and so the climax of the ultimate battle with Zaraki making out alive, eliminating Unohana. He&rsquo;s the lone Kenpachi now and look at his Zanpakuto talking.. we know what that means. Yet another major fight of this cour adapted and animated damn right *chef&rsquo;s kiss*<br />
<br />
The transition in the second half felt a tad strange, though that&rsquo;s to be expected given they left the Ouetsu training regime last time. Moreover Ichigo failed miserably, heck is even forced to go back home. So yep finally time to take a look back at the roots."
"Damn... that was something. The fight between Unohana and Kenpachi was good and also it was nice to see their backstory a little bit. Sad to see that Unohana didn&#039;t survive. RIP Queen. Her Bankai was so scary. I loved it.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it was just Ichigo and Renji meeting the creator of Zanpakuto. Ichigo failed horribly. Now we wait... Btw, those remixes were fire."
"Not sure how to feel about this one, they definitely did something special for the fight animation, but I felt the choreography and specially the music choice to be lackluster&hellip; <br />
<br />
Unohana&rsquo;s bankai looked great, but I felt like it was kinda rushed, I&rsquo;d love for this fight to last the whole episode&hellip; <br />
<br />
Maybe rewatching it with subtitles will make me enjoy it better."
"Damn, seeing all those memories and past fights of Kenpachi even from a narrative perspective gave me chills. <br />
 <br />
This was a really interesting background storytelling about him and the first Kenpachi, aka Retsu Unohana in the present time. Episode found its own to add some comedic light moments but the Kepniachi storytelling is very important about both of their characters.<br />
<br />
Goodbye Yachiru :("
"I wonder what do people here think Unohana bankai does ? <br />
They definitely extended it compared to the manga. But I still don&#039;t get if it&#039;s for healing or melting"
"I&#039;m feeling really conflicted right now because the fight was actually really, REALLY good, arguarbly the second best fight this season (Yama vs Yhwach is still number 1) but the transition between the fight and Oetsu&#039;s part feels too sudden, the directing was actually pretty sloppy this time around. <br />
<br />
I think they should&#039;ve done Oetsu&#039;s scene last episode while making &quot;The Battle&quot; the full fight between Kenpachi and Unohana, with the end credits being the ones we had this episode (with Ichigo going back home). I know that would&#039;ve been two slow/buildup episodes, but it would&#039;ve worked much better overall in terms of hype. If that was the case, I would&#039;ve seen EP8 &amp; EP9 as 7-7.5/10 while EP10 would&#039;ve been a 10/10.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna wait for subs to rewatch it, but overall I would give this one an 8.5/10, fourth best episode of the season, behind Born in the Dark, The Fire and Wrath as a Lightning.<br />
<br />
"
"animation was good but choreography was lacking<br />
8/10<br />
🥲"
"Rest in peace Yachiru Unohana. You died on your own terms for the greater good, and we finally got to clearly see your Bankai in action. While she didn&#039;t explain her power like is normal for a shounen, it doesn&#039;t appear to be too complex of a Bankai to understand.<br />
<br />
Now Zaraki is a true Kenpachi and is likely the most powerful soul reaper alive (or whatever you would classify soul reapers, haha) at the moment. His soul spirit finally called out to him, it&#039;s about time. That will make him even stronger. I can&#039;t wait to see it in action and hear the name.<br />
<br />
Their fight wasn&#039;t as well animated as the fights in episodes 6 and 7, but it was still decent. The flashback scenes were a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Ichigo failing his training is a surprise, but at least now it seems that he is going to sort out all of his past once and for all to truly understand himself so he can bond a true sword spirit.<br />
"
"Damn great fight and episode<br />
The best part of the last arc for me.is next and apparently the episode 12/13 will be a one hour special"
"Unohana and Zaraki&#039;s backstory was absolutely great to see in the anime. True Kenpachi has finally risen and his power will just go up and up after this fight.<br />
"
"RIP Unohana, she was a fine woman, really liked her. Kenpachi&#039;s finally awakened his true power, he already was op but he&#039;s gonna become even more op."
"The battle was great, but Unohana death was beautiful. <br />
<br />
Was good all the lore about the Zanpakutou.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m already excited about the next episode. <br />
 "
"RIP Unohana and Zaraki finally can talk to and know the name of his Zanpakto<br />
<br />
meanwhile Ichigo and Renji are gonna remake their Zanpaktos "

"Kenpachi vs Kenpachi. A battle with a lot of admiration involved.<br />
The direction for this episode was a lot different than I was expecting - this not necessarily means bad, but the staff went with a different approach. I really really think this battle should have consisted of the whole episode 10, it deserved that prestige at least in my eyes, as it&#039;s a battle that impact Zaraki as a character for the rest of the series.<br />
<br />
What I always loved about this battle specifically is the passion these two characters (Zaraki and Unohana) have for battle, or possibly violence itself, I remember the first time I watched Bleach... and that first battle between Ichigo and Zaraki kinda left a mark on me, I immediately thought &quot;this dude is crazy&quot; - when Ichigo cut Zaraki deep. He was happy, happy that Ichigo was slicing him, it was the first time I&#039;ve seen a character that was so in love with fighting. I mean, Goku also is, but Zaraki is different, he doesn&#039;t look as friendly as Goku, he looked menacing, 100% chaotic energy, and as the series progress viewers don&#039;t see him as a villain or bad guy, but instead just some crazy ass masochist dude with a passion for THE BATTLE. <br />
I&#039;d say he&#039;s one of Ichigo&#039;s greatest allies on Soul Society&#039;s side, just for the gratitude he has, as Ichigo gave him lots of fun during their first battle, I also recall for example when Rukia brought him to assist Ichigo against the Fullbringers.<br />
<br />
Unohana on the other hand, we never saw her as bloodthirsty as she is shown in these past 2 episodes, she is firstly presented as the quiet Captain to fourth&#039;s division and main healer of Gotei 13, but then you look up for her old databook infos and you see Kubo put her offensive power at the maximum. Oh, she was a original Gotei 13 member too. She learned to heal her enemies and herself initially just to have more fun during battles &#039;cause they would last longer that way. We see her Bankai here, it&#039;s just... awesome. Even if a lot of people think this battle between her and Zaraki doesn&#039;t make sense. I can&#039;t help but think it&#039;s awesome.<br />
<br />
I always felt like this battle had a subtext to it, kinda subliminal, it almost sounds erotic at times - towards the end when they&#039;re clashing swords and talking about battle with such passion like it&#039;s the only thing that gives them pleasure. I KNOW Unohana&#039;s much older than Zaraki, it&#039;s probably not that deep but that&#039;s just the impression I had by reading the manga.<br />
&quot;Farewell... The one man in this world... who bought me joy.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a post-credits scene featuring Ichigo in front of his house. [spoiler]Ichigo doesn&#039;t know many things about himself yet, about his parents and the past. Oh, and it&#039;s very important for Uryuu as a character as well.<br />
Next episode, as its title suggest, will start the best shonen flashback ever: Everything but the Rain. [/spoiler]<br />

unohanas bankais was insane damn
Shitt Unohanas bankai was fcked sick!! Seeing it finally animated is fckn cool!! 🔥🔥
I think I just watched a romantically tragic story of Zaraki and Unohana... wow...
idk but is it just me or unohana sounded better using her bankai in bbs?it just stuck with me apart from that it was excellent the backstory 😩
"I kind of liked Unohana even before they revealed her nature. Sad she is gone. So she has 2 Bankais, or was the other one a fake? that green pillow creature if I remember correctly.<br />
Her new Bankai is like a Dark Souls weapon, was pretty sick to look at.<br />
And once again Ichigo goes through training and will get some sick abilities later, it&#039;s pretty predictable."
i like it but unohana voice actor so goofy

<br />
Looking forward to seeing how Ichi deals with the loss of Zangetsu. Looks like dude never planned on fixing Zangetsu. It&rsquo;s finally time for Ichigo to have a sit down with Isshin. I&#039;ve been waiting for this for over 10 years."
"HOW DO THEY KEEP THIS QUALITY, amazing episode and a great job done by Pierrot with the source material easy 10/10 anime of the season"
"What a amazing fight between kenpachi zaraki and  Unohana was Zaraki the winner but this fight was intense.<br />
Ichigo has failed he need to go back to his roots."
Backstory around the fight between Kenpachi and Unohana made it have some more depht. The fight itself was just beyond words.
"My jaw is almost literally on the floor. Had to watch it twice. This is just breathtaking.<br />
<br />
Guys the literal first person the Quincies went to murder was Sasakibe. Then Yamamoto. This is likely because those were the ones left killing Yhwach and co. in the past.<br />
<br />
Had Unohana gone out to the battlefield, the quincies would have murdered her too because she was pushed as one of the merciless quincy killers 1000 years ago.<br />

Another banger episode with Kenpachi vs Unohana fight with the introduction of Oetsu and a big cliffhanger for next episode.
tragic outcome by double entry!!! kekeke
animation of TYBW has been amazing so far. cant believe kenpachi&#039;s zanpukto spoke to him after all this time. rip unohana
Sorry boruto but all the budget went to bleach what a banger
omg that fight of two kenpachis is wooooooooooooooooww!!!
this episode was very FREAKING EPIC MAN the fight between kenpachi and unohana was so GREAT and i now wonder what will ichigo do?????/
BAN KAI Minazuki... playtime is over...
It kinda felt like the fight was really fast paced and choreography a bit lacking. Other wise animation was good. They should have extended the fight a bit more longer
kenny vs unohana was peak and oetsu is such a cool guy lol the number one zanpakuto creator and i had goosebumps watching the end of the episode
"[quote=Furyo_enjoyer message=68157816]I wonder what do people here think Unohana bankai does ? <br />

<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/D4f8tq0.png[/img][/quote]<br />
It&rsquo;s not really that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, it&rsquo;s that the fight lacks proper story development and basic set up and payoff. Unohana does nothing all series and then this happens, and we&rsquo;re suddenly lead to believe her entire narrative purpose was to sacrifice herself to make Zaraki stronger. Meanwhile Zaraki has one flashback concerning the whole Yachiru thing and that&rsquo;s the main instance of &ldquo;foreshadowing&rdquo; for this. When I was reading this years ago I couldn&rsquo;t even begin to care about this fight and I still feel the same now. At least it looks nice. <br />
<br />
Also best shonen flashback? Have you read Shaman King? Rurouni Kenshin? Claymore?"
"[quote=Furyo_enjoyer message=68157816]I wonder what do people here think Unohana bankai does ? <br />
They definitely extended it compared to the manga. But I still don&#039;t get if it&#039;s for healing or melting[/quote]<br />
1: she can instantly heal herself<br />
<br />
2: the blood she controls is all the blood of her slain enemy&rsquo;s. Think of byakuyas thousand blades and now think of it like that where every drop of blood is a shard of metal that she can control for both offence and defence<br />
<br />
3: she can open up any and all previous wounds previously healed regardless of if she healed them, someone else or if it was naturally healed. Basically making her Bankai an instant kill if she chooses re-opening an opponents prior deadly injury<br />
<br />
4: just like her Shikai heals, her bankai is the furthest opposite. Her bankai has the ability to inflict immense torture whilst having the ability to heal herself and or opponents instantly. Hence why kenny keeps blacking out and coming back stronger, fully healed.<br />
<br />
I got this info from the bleach wiki fandom. There&rsquo;s more levels to her bankai from what I remember but these are the most noticeable. Feel free to look up the page, it&rsquo;s an interesting read. The 2 sides of the coin of her shikai and bankai are frightening. One to heal, one to kill"
"Episode was mediocre.  They didn&#039;t even expand the fight much nor explain what Unohana&#039;s bankai could do. The entire thing was rushed and sure it was like that in the manga as well but at least the anime should&#039;ve given more context, especially since before the series premiered we were told that some parts of the story would receive additional scenes ffs...<br />
<br />
Also this was the worst instance of a post-credits scene ever. Why do they keep doing that, do they not realize that many viewers stop watching the episodes once the ending credits roll?"
"Unohana has a sick looking bankai but it feels like that fight needed a bit more to it, like it just needed a bit more seeing them duke it out and trading blows."
"And that was it. A really short-lived period where Unohana was actually an interesting character. <br />
At least she got her moment.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to the rest and I guess reading the manga made this not as hype as it should have been."

&gt; Orihime, a human master healer with big tits and no other notable skill, goes out on the battlefield constantly to both heal and fight.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also hard to heal anyone [i]later[/i] when they&#039;re dead."
To think that Zaraki was stronger than the first kempachi while he was only a child and she was a captain is wild.
"This is one of the greatest adaptations of all time. I&#039;m speechless. Unohana&#039;s Bankai was so perfect, I got chills.."
The insight into how bloodthirsty Unohana was back then really was insightful. As was the manner of how she met Kenpachi. But the revelation that he had been unconsciously suppressing his true power was a surprise. Still the fight between the two of them really is entertaining in that while it had excellent action it also combined well with character expansion for the two. The final fight between the two of them really was tragic beyond measure. Hmm so in a way the Asauchi are baby zanpakuto&#039;s huh. But the thought that the soul reapers and the Asauchi train and bond with each other and become actual partners as they both gain in power was a interesting piece of lore. In curious though at what Ichigo would find as he rediscovers his roots though. 
"Honestly as much as I want to praise the animation in this episode, which I do (especially the way they handled Unohana&#039;s Bankai), I just want to praise Fumihiko Tachiki and Aya Hisakawa who really killed it this episode vocally as much as their characters were in trying to literally kill each other. Hisakawa in particular jut did such an amazing job in Unohana&#039;s final episode, and I&#039;m glad she got to go out on a high note for herself and her character."
Quite the contrast going from the Unohana vs Kenpachi fight into Nimaiya&#039;s paradise

I think they wanted to have impact on audience with the kenpachi fight...and don&#039;t want the sad impact to change to  no one zanpakto creator....so first they ended the fight...had their  impact and then moved on ...other wise some people may have been invested in asuachi more...."
"What a conclusion to that fight, with Kenpachi unlocking his true potential thanks to Unohana&#039;s sacrifice. It was cool to see her Bankai and the anime made it look menacing as hell. The backstory was great too. <br />
<br />
More training for Ichigo and Renji but things aren&#039;t looking too good for Ichigo right now. "
"This fight was lit, everything i expected since Yhwach vs Old Man Yama was accomplished. I know the animation is nowhere close but the aesthetic and the backgrounds made the fight really enjoyable (I&#039;ve already read the manga), ichigo being rejected was definitely a good writing point of Kubo, ready for next episode."
I love how unohana healed and killed zaraki again and again 😭💀👍
"Unohana and her bankai were cool, but I&#039;m not sure I understand what it does (instant regeneration maybe?). No visible tear from Kenpachi?<br />
<br />
Nishimaiya was a pleasure to have on the screen, I found him to be rather funny. The way he pronounced &quot;creator&quot; was impressive lol, was expecting something like &quot;kurieetaa&quot;."
"My honest opinion: this fight would be better if they dedicated entire episode to it. With no cuts, no shit. Take half the previous one, and take this one, extend it- and you will get the masterpiece. Meanwhile we got amazing fight... and then focus instantly shifts to Renji and Ichigo. Think of Yamamoto&#039;s death, there wouldn&#039;t be so much hype if the fight was split into parts and immediately after we were shown some other scene for 10 more minutes."

We&#039;re talking about two born killers who always overpowered their opponents, and in Zaraki&#039;s case he barely tries to block most of the time.<br />
<br />
Why would there be a choreography when 2 brutes are fighting?"
"Damn Zaraki and Unohana, Unohana&#039;s defeated happened so... well that was definitely epic, now the 2nd part it was a weird transition but still it turns out Ichigo has to train more by going back at home I wonder it will turn out"
Zaraki becomes Kenpachi by killing Unohana. Now the bois have to fight with nameless Zanpaktou to have their swords fixed

Thank the heavens, one of the worst characters in Bleach is finally gone. And her dying gave Kenpachi a power up, talk about killing 2 birds with 1 stone.<br />
[quote=Akil29 message=68158188]I was suprised to see how there were no cuts or extends in this episode this was the most manga canon 1:1 adapted episode. [spoiler]Next episode will have the anime-onlies lose their s*hit by shock and how the story of BLEACH started at first place. Next episode will show what BLEACH&#039;s story was all about and not just random ass-pulls or whatever haters say.[/spoiler][/quote]There&#039;s plenty of asspulls and plot convenience in Bleach.<br />

[i]Mod Edit: Modified quote of edited post.[/i][/quote]<br />
<br />
You clearly dont get why she doesn&#039;t go out to fight<br />
Do you ask a War doctor in battle field to go on battle field to combat?<br />
They need to keep her hidden/ safe so she can heal the wounded later.<br />
The 1st captain ORDERED her to never charge out to combat.[/quote]&gt; Unohana, a master healer who was previously Kenpachi, doesn&#039;t go out on the battlefield to either heal or fight.<br />
&gt; Orihime, a human master healer with big tits and no other notable skill, goes out on the battlefield constantly to both heal and fight.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also hard to heal anyone [i]later[/i] when they&#039;re dead.[/quote]<br />
<br />
And then Orihime ends up getting captured all the time lolz<br />
She&#039;s just a dumb nice girl who just doesnt concern about her wellbeing, not a soldier or doctor who need to make sure they&#039;re alive to save people .<br />
<br />
Like I said 1st captain ORDERED Unohana to nvr charge out to combat cuz she&#039;s like the last insurance backup of soul society.<br />
They do not know the full capability/ strength / perks of the enemies yet so is rational for them to not risk their best healer in frontline.<br />
Unohaha trusted First captain&#039;s judgement cuz she believes he can win.  She never have expected first captain to be defeated, nor is everyone else ."
"I think this was a good episode, but I actually don&#039;t think it was as good as it could have been.<br />
It&#039;s my own fault for getting caught up in the hype for this fight. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it was a good fight, but I was expecting them to add a bit more to it. For example, the details of Minazuki are still pretty unclear.<br />
Still a good episode but it could, and should, have been so much more.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m incredibly excited to see Everything But the Rain from next week, as well as the community reaction to what is to come."
"Yuuup, what ichigo needs is to know who he really is, i feel your identity ichigo is too ambiguous. Cool episode for this week, i hope next episode explain exactly who ichigo really is."
It was such an interesting episode.  It&#039;s a rather relatable situation that things happen and we don&#039;t understand the meaning and the reason behind it.  This episode had a rather smooth and peaceful vibe.

Please stop asking info dumps for Bleach as that would ruin the series. There&#039;s beauty and poetry in subtext and we do not need to be told exactly what something as conceptual as a zanpakuto power should do as those are based on the very soul of the user."
very cool! i like it
a wonderrful fight  that was amazing
"So Unohana&#039;s been killing and healing Zaraki that&#039;s why he&#039;s experiencing blackouts <br />
There&#039;s an after credits scene<br />
"
"rip Unohana T_T on the other hand, rip Ichigo in a completely different way lol. I guess he&#039;s going to learn about his mom and maybe something more about his dad"
"I really love how they did the Kenpachi vs Unohana fight. I&#039;m still sad that Unohana had to die here, she was always the best Bleach waifu imo and just when we found out she was even more badass than we thought she dies. Its a shame but its how it has to be."
"[quote=Ary125tues message=68159416][quote=Early_Morning message=68159159]Episode was mediocre.  They didn&#039;t even expand the fight much nor explain what Unohana&#039;s bankai could do. The entire thing was rushed and sure it was like that in the manga as well but at least the anime should&#039;ve given more context, especially since before the series premiered we were told that some parts of the story would receive additional scenes ffs...<br />
<br />
Also this was the worst instance of a post-credits scene ever. Why do they keep doing that, do they not realize that many viewers stop watching the episodes once the ending credits roll?[/quote]<br />
I don&#039;t know about you...but they do post credit since  ep 1 of tybw...every watcher is used to it....and also they added many new scene from the manga....they need to cover a lot with additional scenes....and no way it was mediocre...though it was still fast paced...[/quote]<br />
I&#039;m basing the post-credit remark on what I&#039;ve witnessed myself; I watch multiple reaction mashups of the episodes every week, and every week there&#039;s at least a dozen people who skip the post-credit scenes accidentally because they don&#039;t realize that they exist. This episode was the worst instance so far imo because the post-credit scene was actually really important and longer than the others.<br />
<br />
And I&#039;m not denying that the anime has added a few scenes, just not ones that are actually useful. The Uryu scenes only add extra foreshadowing for something that manga readers already know will happen and even anime-only viewers are unlikely to get much benefit from the extra Uryu scenes in the long run. Some fights have had a couple seconds of material added in, but again so far they&#039;ve been minor scenes. This fight which was one of the most anticipated of the series really should&#039;ve been expanded imo, by at least adding some dialogue explaining Unohana&#039;s bankai so that people don&#039;t have to research it themselves."
BANKAI MINAZUKI!!!!!!!!!
"The animation was amazing as always, but I expected more from the fight and Unohana&#039;s character, idk... If she&#039;s really dead, I&#039;m sorry, but I think Kubo wasted her character."
Even though I knew it was coming for years thanks to spoilers. It still hurts
"insane . the bankai of unohana and the fight was just insane , but  im angry i dont want unohana died ... anyway i&#039;ll wait the  next ep , i want to know wht Ichigo will do ."
"[quote=IDani35 message=68160688]The animation was amazing as always, but I expected more from the fight and Unohana&#039;s character, idk... If she&#039;s really dead, I&#039;m sorry, but I think Kubo wasted her character.[/quote]<br />
<br />
This is something good but also bad about Bleach. Kubo is really good at creating amazing designs and characters. The problem is there is so many of them that a lot of them don&#039;t get the screentime to shine or even get to show their powers <br />
<br />
I would have loved to see her more. But at least we got to see her use her powers and she got an emotional death that kinda made sense as a Kenpachi."
THAT WAS SO GOOODDDDDDD OMGGGGG
"So Ichigo was sent back home without Zangetsu, I imagine he&#039;ll ask his Dad about his Mom being a Quincy and that&#039;ll be the key.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Orihime, Chad, and Urahara are just chilling in Hueco Mundo.<br />
<br />
"
&Eacute; agora que come&ccedil;a o choro
"[quote=Furyo_enjoyer message=68157816]I wonder what do people here think Unohana bankai does ? <br />
They definitely extended it compared to the manga. But I still don&#039;t get if it&#039;s for healing or melting[/quote]<br />
It literally melts you to ashes in a painful way, but her healing is faster so she can regenerate Zaraki and melt him again and again."
"[quote=DoubleR message=68158289]I kind of liked Unohana even before they revealed her nature. Sad she is gone. So she has 2 Bankais, or was the other one a fake? that green pillow creature if I remember correctly.<br />
Her new Bankai is like a Dark Souls weapon, was pretty sick to look at.<br />
And once again Ichigo goes through training and will get some sick abilities later, it&#039;s pretty predictable.[/quote]<br />
that green pillow creature is her shikai, having the same name but different pronunciation"
mommy unohana is gone for good:(
"Zaraki&#039;s wide af mouth looked a bit weird, but the rest was 🔥🔥🔥"
"They didn&#039;t do the best job with Unohana vs Kenpachi, they shouldn&#039;t have half of the fight happens in the last episode and the second in this one, it felt like it was rushed, too fast, it should have been a entire episode for these 2, it would have been perfect, also, the constant change of tone from super serious to super silly doesn&#039;t work that well sometimes, i remember this was a criticism point at the time, about the Squad 0 being too much of a clown and the anime is for sure making me remember it kkk."
"My excitement was through the roof watching the first half. Unohana&rsquo;s bankai is sick af. I felt that they should&rsquo;ve expanded the fight more because it was a bit short but nevertheless the animation was perfect. Still sad that Unohana had to die since she&rsquo;s a great character but I&rsquo;m glad that they gave us a glimpse of her past at least. I could see that despite being a cold-blooded killer, the past hundred years did change Unohana that also includes Yamaji. She definitely didn&rsquo;t appear as cold on her fight with Zaraki but more like threatening in a teacher kind of way, the emotion she showed through her eyes was a nice touch. Also, the transition on the second half was weird lol. Can&rsquo;t wait to see Isshin&rsquo;s appearance and the revelation."

"Plenty of manservice. Though that&rsquo;s to be expected with an onsen segment with only men around, except it was all for training. Cleared the first stage, not just Ichigo but Renji as well, so what next? Fulling your belly of course. Though it shouldn&#039;t come off as an &ldquo;of course&rdquo;, given the dudes are training themselves for the next invasion, but yeah that&rsquo;s the kind of family friendly training arc it is. Chef&rsquo;s kiss for Kirio&rsquo;s transformation btw.<br />
<br />
Though the serious part, that grand coming of age clash between Unohona, the first &ldquo;Kenpachi&rdquo; and Zaraki Kenpachi. They reordered the chapters, or more like delayed the meeting of Ichigo and Oetsu, and I think we got a better part or almost most of the fight in the second half itself. Didn&rsquo;t disappoint with the choreography, and with that Unohana stare as well. It still ain&rsquo;t the end, the best parts will be coming from here on."
"Some nice and chill moments between Ichigo and Renji like in the good old days. That food looked really delicious. And, it was great to see Kon back and being with the boys. They sure had a lot of fun with that banquet. Also, there were some milkers. <br />
<br />
But, the highlight of the episode was the fight between Unohana and Kenpachi which was great. Loved seeing how powerful Unohana actually is. Another good episode."
"With all the drama and intense fights in this arc so far, I almost forgot how fun the anime can be when there&#039;s the light humor. Welcome back Kon. He&#039;s like a meme in this franchise but happy to see him again.<br />
<br />
And lol, Ichigo and Renji had a hell of a meal. <br />
<br />
Also, daily reminder that Kenpachi is a badass."
Amazing episode. As a manga reader they definitely did the Kenpachi scene justice
I thought keeny vs unohana would be the whole episode but im not complaining
"The first half of the episode was classic old Bleach with its comedic bits. Ichigo&#039;s, Renji&#039;s, and Kon&#039;s faces when Kirio Hikifune transformed were hilarious. The hot springs section was pretty short, and I would have liked to see more with that, but the eating section did its job and didn&#039;t feel that rushed, though I would have liked them to be there a bit longer as well (and not just because of the eye candy, haha).<br />
<br />
Kyoraku being chosen as the next squad 1 captain was the obvious choice. Hope he manages to keep Nanao with him. <br />
<br />
The fight between Zaraki and Unohana should be a sight to behold as it&#039;s a fight between two legendary Kenpachis going all out. The sad faces of their lieutenants were heartbreaking to watch, especially with Isane&#039;s tears. "
"Finally the Unohana reveal, if it wasn&#039;t obvious enough from the flashbacks of OG gotei 13 already. Still a good way to reveal it, love her. Zaraki&#039;s training begins and I&#039;m not ready for what&#039;s about to happen damn it. Kirio looked hot af slimmed down, Kubo waifus are the best."
"the zero division, the training in royal palace and the kenpachi&#039;s??? bro what more do you want!"
"mother unohana is the mother of mothers<br />
"
the revelation of two kenpachi? and the new head captain? this is getting interesting.
"I knew she probably has a secret or a trick, but I need expected Unohana to be that strong. Her abilities are more towards healing rather than killing after all.<br />
"
"FINALLY, UNOHANA&#039;S REVEAL.<br />
This episode, like the last one, was pretty decent, Kirio&#039;s in her fitness form is a hottie, but episode 10 is what I&#039;m waiting for the most.<br />
<br />
I mean, we already saw the beginning of Kenpachi vs Kenpachi here, but next one has potential to end up being my favorite anime episode ever IF PROPERLY ADAPTED AND ANIMATED. I just love that battle so much, it&#039;s my favorite in the entirely of Bleach. Hope they didn&#039;t wasted all the sakuga on Yamaji vs Yhwach.<br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/9XMDIQj.png[/img]"
the episode slapped as usual also can anyone please tell me the name of the OST that plays when kyouraku introduces unohana towards the beginning i don&#039;t remember it all 😭
"there it is Zarakis ability is that he is like a Saiyan with Zenkai Boost or the more he is close to being killed the more stronger he becomes later on<br />
<br />
and oh no the fat lady is actually sexy hot <br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/bV4PYvw.png[/img]"
"See Nanao brought a strange happiness to my heart.<br />
<br />
I was expecting Kirio thin form, but I still broke a sweat seeing her.<br />
<br />
Yachiru!<br />
<br />
Unohana showing why everyone respect her."
"Unohana reveal is one who actually make sense, I&#039;m 100% sure she was planned"
"Very good episode from the comedic chill moments between ichigo and renji to the unohana and kenpachi scenes. <br />
<br />
[img]https://imgur.com/znoQftg.png[/img]"
Damnn Unohana has always been so coldd!! 🔥🥶
Kenpachi for the win
"Ichigo and renji are have a training and now that one of the squad zero is saying ichigo has such a potential what a hype.<br />
Unohana and zenpachi are fighting and one of them is dying."
"Finally some Classic old bleach moments. Renji and Ichigo arguing and of course who could forget Kon. Onsen was a little rushed but the food moments didn&#039;t feel that way <br />
<br />
Kenpachi vs Kenpachi has finally begun. Really waited for it ever since I read the manga. Unohana reveal was splendidly done. Next episode&#039;s definitely gonna be a banger"
"Not bad, not bad at all.<br />
The first palace seems to be rushed as well as the second one. I can&#039;t wait for the 3rd one!<br />
<br />
Renji feels like a different person when he became a talkative critique earlier lol, even Ichigo was weirded out... lmao. Where are the others though? Where&#039;s Rukia...?! (⁠っ⁠˘̩⁠╭⁠╮⁠˘̩⁠)⁠っ<br />
<br />
P.S. I didn&#039;t expect the squad captain for the healing squad to be stronger than... lol<br />

"I was surprised and happy Renji took that hit and stayed his ground. <br />
<br />
The first Kenpachi? That hit me like the white truck of doom. Totally out of nowhere. I knew Unohana was hiding something, but I never thought she was a beast! So is she almost killing Kenny and then healing him? My mind is so far blown! I need a lay down. Thinking about taking the rest of the day at work."
"Sweet baby squeepigs.  Now that is an episode.  I dont normally talk about the animation of an eps, but this was spot on given there with the two captains duking it out.  Im hoping neither have to die, and it will be most interesting if Kenpachi realises his bankai!!<br />
"
Amazing episode. I&#039;ve been waiting to see Mommy in action for 10 years. Feels good. Shunsui is now the Captain Commander of the Gotei 13.
EPIC BACK SOUND PRODUCTION!!!!
Oooh can&#039;t wait for the next episode!! Animation as always is crisp. Im expecting a sakuga fest in next episode. Hope Pierrot won&#039;t disappoint.This episode had the return of CHAD KON.
"Absolutely love the contrast between Unohana&#039;s cold stares and warm voice. It sends chills down my spine. <br />
Kenpachis&#039; battle next week. What did I do to deserve such heavenly Mondays?  "
"zaraki vs unohana lessgooo<br />
unohana is op"
"Best episode!<br />
And the nextone will be even better &quot;cough&quot; blood *cough*"
best ep...zaraki vs unohana
"Finally, we can see Kenpachi fight. Next ep will be a banger."
A training arc for the boys and Zaraki
ichigo and renji the buddies LOL
ngl scary Unohana is too hot
Bleach delivers yet again. This arc is not just about hype fights. Reveals like these are what makes this arc so special. Unohana vs Zaraki now. I can surely tell that Kenpachi is going to win this one.
Again a peak episode  and  can&#039;t wait for the fight between  Zaraki and Unohana 🤩🤩
"I&#039;m genuinely surprised that they slowed down the pacing this much. I thought they&#039;d rush and make the Unohana fight end in this episode, but they actually left some slow light-hearted moments in and only adapted half of the fight. That being said, the animation during the fight wasn&#039;t as great as I was expecting."
"The ost playing when the fight was about to start and we got to see the vice captains had me excited. I wish the episode would have ended right when Unohana penetrated Kenpachi&#039;s throat, but maybe that would have seemed cheap. <br />
<br />
Bath-guy is cool, so is Renji-kun."
"what the flop is going on man??!<br />
crazy stuff."
unohana reveal was amazing
"Good episode, ichigo and Renji were recovering from their last battle. The Kenpachi vs Unohana fight is gonna be awesome I can&#039;t wait for next week"
Great change in the kitchen1!!! kekeke
"Unohana&#039;s reveal is everything for me. I&#039;ve always wondered who the woman was with the hair down and always let myself believe it was someone other than Unohana. Seems like it&#039;s not and she is quite the opposite of what I thought she&#039;d be. She&#039;s as ruthless and fearless as Kenpachi, or even more than him (back then probably). That one frame is legit one of the coldest shot ever imo. I can definitly see her raising as my one of my favorite Bleach characters. She got everything to be one of the coldest and baddest female characters.<br />
Aside from that, Ichigo and Renji are the only two for now that can stand up for themselves and heading to the third process. Oh man, my jaw dropped when she lost all her fat. That&#039;s quite the woman tbh.<br />
Back to the Kenpachi vs Unoha, the small bits of choreography were displayed incredibly well and powerful. The constant transitions to other scenes made it have a bit more depht (Isane crying and yachiru calling out his name), but hopefully, they&#039;ll show the full battle without anything else.<br />

"Watching Kenpachi &amp; Unohara fight literally had me holding my chair OwO internally screaming, what a powerful fighting scene o(*≧▽≦)ツ┏━┓"
"Oh, I was waiting for the introduction of Oetsu but I guess they went with Retsu vs Kenny first.<br />
<br />
I love the Retsu reveal and the story with Kenny!"
"BLEACH has finally made its great return to the mainstream. Many said it was impossible to happen (mostly stupid haters just for the sake of it), but here we are with the most important release of the year, whether you like it or not."
Superb episode and the kenpachi v unohana fight will be awesome
"The first episode contains relaxing content and the second part is the start of an iconic fight for Bleach fans.I&#039;m glad they didn&#039;t force this episode to become a full Unohana Vs Kenpachi battle, with this decision maybe I can hope that the next episode will be a super exciting episode like episodes 6&amp;7. I can&#039;t wait for episode 10, maybe it will be a super cool episode.<br />
<br />
Good Episode 5/5"
unohana and zaraki really cold af
"&quot;Battle is everything.&quot;<br />
Unohana has such a great voice actress."
Unohana looks scary... I wanted to see more of the other captains too... let&#039;s wait
Of course low budget anime has to remake flashbacks three times instead of being creative. But the plot is one of the best so at least it wasn&#039;t a waste.
very good food very good introduction of kenny and unohana
"4/5<br />
<br />
I gotta say, I enjoyed this episode more than others so far. It&#039;s certainly not the best episode of this cour but something about the masterclass in direction and animation in the last 10 mins made this my personal favorite this season <br />
<br />
Kyoraku is appointed as the new squad 1 leader reluctantly but he is already making logical moves to protect soul society from future invasions like releasing the full potential of Zaraki Kenpachi via the first Kenpachi, Unohana. Her reveal was one ive been waiting for a while. It does not make took much sense for her to be a very overpowered being now because of her very timid demeanor before this arc but hey, im not complaining. The fact that she was one of the OG gotei squad member should be justification enough.<br />
<br />
Ichigo &amp; Renji duo scenes were good. They are bumping through the squad 0 levels pretty easily. There were some important info dump on how each squad zero member play an integral role in the prosperity of the soul world. Next stop is the Zanpaktou dude<br />
<br />
The Kenpachi feud was the obvious glaring highlight of the episode with it&#039;s immaculate frame compositions and movement cutting through scenes, perfectly blending the tense ost in the background. The animation even though mostly stills, was very fluid and gorgeous. The atmosphere and ambience in the mugen also fits perfectly with the scenes being played out <br />
<br />
I have been enjoying Bleach more recently than the weeks following it&#039;s premiere. So many revelations and sequences yet to come and with such care in direction and choreography, i&#039;m eager to consume more "
Can&rsquo;t wait for next week
MOMMY UNOHANA LESSS GOOO
Unohana gave me chills. Insane first Kenpachi reveal. Almost as good as Hikifune&#039;s glow up.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
"[quote=Yoarry message=68112205]Unohana reveal is one who actually make sense, I&#039;m 100% sure she was planned[/quote]<br />
<br />
Yes back in Soul Society arc, in Ken&#039;s flashback he finds Yachiru and names after the person he respects most. He takes the Kenpachi name as well even though he wasn&#039;t in Gotei 13 <br />
<br />
A lot of subtle foreshadowing from Kubo that only pan out in TYBW"
"Some nice chill moments as we see Ichigo and Renji recovering with the members of Squad Zero, but the highlight of the episode was of course the reveal that Unohana is actually the first Kenpachi, as she and current Kenpachi clash. Next episode is gonna be a banger after getting a taste of that battle in this episode. <br />
<br />
Also, congrats to Shunsui for getting a promotion to become the new Captain-General. "
"It&#039;s the episode we were all waiting for. <br />

Unohana so cold that I&#039;m freezing 
Best anime everrrrrrrrrrr
the adaptation of the long awaited fight between the two kenpachis was gorgeous
"We finally saw the cold blooded Retsu, if they extend the fight between two Kenpachi&#039;s there will be alot of bloodshed.<br />
"
"Bro what just happened rn Unohana was the first Kampatchi ngl she looked menacing in this episode but imagine how strong and op Kampatchi would be if he uses his Zampacto&rsquo;s ability&rsquo;s but anyway Unohana is so fine 😩<br />
<br />
"
the episode was good and with that the fight of the captains that in the next episode will heat up and explain a lot!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱😱😱😱😱
"Seeing Unohana finally go all out was amazing!<br />
Can&#039;t wait for the battle next week!!"
having my favorite bleach fight get animated is a blessing. Much more to see in the next ep.
Kenpachi becoming stronger. Such a tease this episode was.
"This episode was the peak, especially the second part."
"Had the same reaction as Ichigo and Renji to Kirio&#039;s upgraded form<br />
<br />
Good build-up for Unohana vs Kenpachi<br />
<br />
Kenpachi is essentially a saiyan"
"Que o Shinsui fosse nomeado o capit&atilde;o geral j&aacute; era de se esperar, agora a Unohana ser essa psicopata eu definitivamente n&atilde;o esperava."
Unohana gives me straight chills
It was AWESOME!!! I always liked Retsu but after that episode I love her &lt;3. The start of fight was amazing. That scene was just stunning.
Zajebiste w chuj Kozackie Mega
can someone explain to me why there are so many notes 1? How is it possible for someone to be on episode 9 and still give a 1? It&#039;s almost 5% of the votes
Well it&#039;s looking more and more like the rest of the episodes will for the most part just be setting up for the next invasion or whatever
"Ohh the Kenpatchi - Unohana fight at the end was already incredible in the scans but to see it in anime, it&#039;s simply incredible ! 😱😍"
"My dumb arse got confused with the term &quot;Kenpachi&quot; since I thought they were talking about Zaraki Kenpachi; the battle between Unohana and Kenpachi left me speechless &#039;cause I had no idea why they were even fighting. I had to look it up to understand this lmfaoooo. Overall, I love how menacing Unohana looks! "
"OHMYGOOOO?????? MY JAW LITERALLY DROPPED WHEN CAPT. KYORAKU SAID &quot;Captain Unohana... No. The First Kenpachi, Unohana Yachiru.&quot; UWAAAHHHHH I ALREADY LOVED HER EVEN WHEN I NEVER SAW HER FIGHT NOW I LOVE HER EVEN MORE AAAAAAA"
"Oh my god, what a GOATed episode. This has probably been the best airing anime I&#039;ve seen that&#039;s actually lived up to the hype, at least in my books. Every damn episode has been so good, I am left pondering what just happened and wanting more, so many interesting reveals and happenings right now. "
"Kirio goes from cute chubby mother to hot slim mommy in a matter of minutes, you got to respect Tite Kubo for that.<br />
I have been waiting to see Unohana vs Kenpachi in the anime for so long, its so satisfying!"
Retsu&rsquo;s glare gave me chills holy shit. Kirio hot af. Goated episode
plot twist 100 (╯&deg;□&deg;）╯︵ ┻━┻
best episode ever
"[quote=Despa_Best_Boy message=68112988]Of course low budget anime has to remake flashbacks three times instead of being creative. But the plot is one of the best so at least it wasn&#039;t a waste.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Of course people who have no clue about how a anime production works will use &quot;low budget&quot; as argument."
very cool series!
Unohana on that episode was freaking awesome 👍
";.;.;/.;;..~~./;&acute;[,./-0=&#039;\,+.+.+.++..++.+.+.+.+.+.++.+.+.+.+.+-+."
"I thought that moronic first half meant the good times were over, but Kenny x Unohana definitely works. It&#039;s always the quiet girls you gotta&#039; look out for."
"The first part was nice, especially Kirio true hotness, but although Kenpachis fight was really great overall (damn, man... wtf those Unohana eyes...) I was expecting much more from the swordsmanship choreography itself... Some moves are really hard to tell and still has those cuts when you don&#039;t even see the swords brandishing, like that moment when Unohana attacks and Zaraki&#039;s sword appears flying... <br />
<br />
Anyway, it was a great episode and I&#039;m hope the next is gonna be much better."
"The Kenpachi reveal. I always thought it was interesting that Unohana was &quot;a&quot; Kenpachi. Though, I felt the follow-through was a bit lacking."

"Dealing with the aftermath of storm Sternritters and Yhwach left soul society with. Plentiful deaths, uncountable casualties and more so the death of captain commander Yamamoto. Can&#039;t blame even the cool headed captains getting worked up. Though it isn&#039;t just them dealing with the hardships here, Ichigo&rsquo;s on the same boat with his broken Zanpakuto.<br />
<br />
Though whom to help with this ever old problem this time around? Zero division. Good to see the team of five making into the adaptation, though we already had a glance of them in the opening but still. It&rsquo;s off to a brief training time in the palace of the king of souls from here on, not just for Ichigo but for Renji, Rukia and Byakuya as well. Hot Springs the first spot xD <br />
<br />
Also have to mention about some of the old faces making their return, from Kon to the Fullbringers. But most important of all, it&rsquo;s official that the one who saved Urahara and the gang back in Hueco Mundo from Quilge was no one other than GRIMMJOW AKA THE SECOND BEST BOY. <br />
<br />
Suwabe Junichi&rsquo;s voice is so easy to recognize lol."
"Well... the aftermath of the battle can definitely be seen in all of the Soul Society. They can&#039;t even mourn. I feel bad for them. Many are injured and I hope they&#039;ll be back on their feet soon enough. They felt so emotionally vulnerable, especially Soi fon even tho she&#039;s a captain. The Zero squad is cool honestly.<br />
<br />
Some new faces and some old familiar faces were also in this episode. Loved seeing all of them. Pretty light-hearted episode IMO which was needed after all the shit everyone went through. No Rukia fanservice... Big L."
"Shinji&#039;s personality never ceases to amuse me, even in this season. Glad to see him back again.<br />
<br />
Looks like this episode serves as the aftermath of the recent fights. Seeing Ichigo and the others all bandaged up hurts. Slower paced episode th"
Zero division finally here. Time for some training. K vs K coming up in the next couple of episodes as well. This cour is just going to get better.
"The episode was pretty good, I like the introduction of the squad zero, some sort of training arc about to happen??!<br />
<br />
I need to rewatch it with subs, but i didn&rsquo;t get the idea of you not being able to restore a broken bankai, I feel like we&rsquo;ve seen that happen before.<br />
<br />
Also, is it just me or Shinji VA sounded different? Maybe I&rsquo;m just imagining things&hellip; by the way, I never realized he spoke in such a strong Kansai accent before lol"

"It&#039;s great to see that all of Ichigo&#039;s close soul reaper friends managed to survive the battle. There were so many great cameos this episode! From the arrancar with Urahara who looks like was probably Grimmjow, to the three dead Fullbringers with the Shiba clan alongside Kukaku Shiba mentioning their uncle (Ichigo&#039;s dad). We also got to see Kon, squad zero, and the Soul King. <br />
<br />
There appears to be a little bit of rivalry between squad zero and the 13 court guard squads. I must say, I really like their designs and their attitudes. <br />
<br />
This series needed an episode to cool down after the non-stop action, and I think this did a really good job of that. We got a lot of info in this episode and it looks like the soul society and the main characters will be able to gain enough strength in the future to at least put up a decent defense before the next invasion and not get curve-stomped. <br />
<br />
I would say my favorite parts of the episode were just seeing the captains interacting with one another. Both from squad zero vs Gotei 13 and from the vizard captains vs the non-vizard captains. The character interactions really portray a rich history and deep internal conflicts between them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to one of the most powerful characters in Bleach.<br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/y6SZkue.png[/img]<br />
<br />
Decent episode, after two amazing episodes full of action and important stuff happening with no time to let you breathe, it&#039;s expected to see things settle down a bit for now."
Okay episode... Nothing really to talk about with animation or storyboard. Cut comedy is fine. Byakuya not dying will forever be Kubo&#039;s biggest fumble. Squad 0 are cool enough. 6/10
The Gotei 13 and Soul Society are completely messed up while the Zero Division are hilarious. It&#039;s quite interesting contrast. 
Fantastic ep!! Love to see Squad Zero!!
"the Squad Zero and Soul King are finally here, great episode<br />
<br />
also there its implied that Grimmjow is the one that help Urahara, Orihime and Sado against that Jail quincy "
"HE IS BACKKKKKKKkk <br />
[img]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiqeCqyXEAI1lyn?format=jpg[/img]"
THEY SHOWED GRIMMJOW! He wasn&#039;t showed in Manga. The anime is soo much better than the manga. Plus return of king KON. The animation is soo clean
"Pretty good episode. <br />
<br />
As much as I like Byakuya I was hoping he would have been killed off. Would have been perfect last episode. Not surprised should have been expecting him to live since its bleach."
"There is 3 big problems with this anime with 2 coming from manga itself.<br />
<br />
1- Pacing<br />
<br />
Pacing is extremely fast, they cut too much and squeezing scenes to fit so much in one episode. There is no way non-manga readers can feel or understand anything at this point.<br />
<br />
2- Writing<br />
<br />
Writing was always bad in Bleach because Tite Kubo is bad writer. Soul Society Arc was his best. There was no reason to Byakuya survive but he survives anyway.<br />
<br />
3- Worldbuilding<br />
<br />
Worldbuilding doesn&#039;t make sense even from the first episode, there is no correlation between anything, there is no reason, explanation, how this works, how that works etc. etc. "
As an anime only its nice to finally get to see the Royal Palace 
Solid episode but they cut the peach scene so I am incredibly disappointed
"So when Ichigo and others were launched to Soul Palace, were those Xcusion members with them? Didn&#039;t they die?"
"Squad zero makes their entrance and their members got quite the personalities. Feels like a fun bunch. I&#039;m glad Byakuya survived, hope he gets better after the treatment from squad zero. Glad to see Orihime and others doing well and seems like Grimmjow&#039;s with them."
"[quote=begija message=68061609]So when Ichigo and others were launched to Soul Palace, were those Xcusion members with them? Didn&#039;t they die?[/quote]<br />
They died as human and back to Soul Society as souls."
"Is kinda sad using Soi Fon as plot device to say what the audience is thinking, but is always good to see Soi Fon.<br />
<br />
We got to see Shutara. This is a good day.<br />
<br />
Grimmjow&#039;s abs.<br />
<br />
More about Ichigo&#039;s family. Today cousins."
"Anyone like the additional scenes Kubo added in this episode? Like them mentioning Isshin saying &ldquo;Even if it makes Uncle sad&rdquo; as well as them showing Ginjo and the others earlier? I don&rsquo;t think I remember seeing that in the manga. <br />
<br />
This episode was slower, as to be expected, but overall amazing just like the rest!"
"[quote=Okeanix message=68061642][quote=begija message=68061609]So when Ichigo and others were launched to Soul Palace, were those Xcusion members with them? Didn&#039;t they die?[/quote]<br />
They died as human and back to Soul Society as souls.[/quote]<br />
that&#039;s kinda weird, since I remember in last episode (366) Ichigo went to Soul Society to retrieve Ginjo&#039;s body. That would mean both his soul and body were there."
"After 4 episodes of absolute fire, we&#039;re met with the calm of the storm we just went through. Not much here to say other than being surprised with comedy right off the bat, not a bad thing, after all, there&#039;s a lot of potential for comic relief after such an incident, and even still there manages to be a sad and tense tone in the aftermath of the invasion.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re introduced to Squad 0, who&#039;re willing to help Ichigo and restore Rukia, Renji and Byakuya. It seems Kubo is not killing Byakuya in the anime either which is understandable given the hell he went through the first time.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of foreshadowing in this episode, especially regarding Unohana and some cameos of Grimmjow and the Fullbringers, which I don&#039;t recall them being cameo&#039;d that early in the manga, but it&#039;s something that really excited me.<br />
<br />
[quote=Emblemz message=68061470] Byakuya not dying will forever be Kubo&#039;s biggest fumble. Squad 0 are cool enough. 6/10[/quote]<br />
<br />
That wasn&#039;t really Kubo&#039;s fault, he was pressured a lot with death threats from Byakuya fanboys, and while is sad that he kept him alive in the anime, I wouldn&#039;t say it was a fumble, it&#039;s sad how much power some salty fanboys have over someone&#039;s work. <br />

Do not pay attention to Okeanix, he&#039;s giving you misinformation. Shinigamis have the power to send off souls to the Soul Society, if humans are killed, they become spirits that will wander until either they&#039;re attacked by hollows, lose their mind and become hollows, or they&#039;re sent off by a Shinigami, it&#039;s one of the most basic things Bleach teaches early on. So, Shinigamis defeated the Fullbringers, they died, and they went to Soul Society mostly because they were slain by Shinigamis.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some details regarding Ginjo, but I can&#039;t speak much there because it&#039;s been a while. <br />

"After a bunch of action-packed episodes, this was a breather and a change of pace which was the right idea at least on paper. I normally can enjoy breather episodes but this was really boring to me and I would say easily the least enjoyable episode so far from this entry. I&#039;ve enjoyed much better breather episodes like these many other times compared to this one. Hopefully should be better with the next episode. At least there were some introductions and build to work as foreshadowing for the rest of the series."

Gigai for what? For Gigai is for Shinigami to &quot;implant&quot; their soul in order to be in the world of living. It has nothing to do with Soul Society."
"Bleach has no business being this good after all these years they kept me waiting. When I got to this part in manga I was sure they couldn&#039;t possibly make it more interesting in anime. Each new episode I get surprised and even more excited than the last. When I think &quot; ok nothing can beat this scene visually&quot;, next episode looks even better. The characters have more depth than they ever had in the series. This should be the new standard for all the other shows."
Grimmjow is back Bois!

<br />
I Might be wrong then. But don&#039;t give it too much thought, he was still slain by a Shinigami and his soul would still go to the Soul Society afterwards. Ichigo only retrieved his body for an overglorified funeral. Also, Xcution members appeared late in this arc, they actually showed them early in the anime, there&#039;s a good chance Kubo will use the cut content to add new content regarding them and further explain this, let&#039;s hope that&#039;s the case.<br />

The Soul Society has not experienced this kind of a large scale attack in a long time. A lot of things change from here. We finally get to see the Zero division. They are a bunch of weird yet awesome guys imo. It&#039;s time for the training arc now!!!! We also get to see a few old characters back on screen!!! Overall this was a good episode.

Aren&#039;t they 5 of the original 13?  They look like it.  They let the old man go out like that.  Anywho...  why didn&#039;t they take Kinny I wonder. He&#039;s as bad off as Byakuya.

"Probably the most underwhelming episode by this season&#039;s standards imho, but I thought it was a nice respite episode, if anything, considering how tense and heavy the past few episodes have been. Funny enough how it kinda just flew by and felt short, which goes to show how nicely directed it still was, even as a less prioritized segment production-wise. It&#039;s especially nice here getting some needed context about one&#039;s Bankai being broken as well as introducing Squad Zero, the Royal Palace, and the Soul King for the first time. Comedy feels quite muted compared to the manga from my perspective but the more warmer colors here give that needed fuzzy comfortable feeling and a bit of nostalgia considering how the original Bleach anime looked (despite that one&#039;s own inconsistencies).<br />
As much as I love the TYBW arc, I still am not really fond of Byakuya being saved, though I can completely get the unfortunate circumstances behind that which were related to Kubo facing lots of death threats at the time he was writing that part in the manga. Hopefully the adaptation will implement something to justify his survival, whether through emotional context or some logical explanation.<br />
<br />

[i]Mod Edit: Removed spoiler.[/i]"
"it was chill episode after war, loved it"
Zero squad?! A lot of misteries !!!! kekeke
Bro kill this stupid soi fon character in anime please 🙏 . 5/5 episode coz its bleach but have to give this a 2/5 because of soi fon
[quote=Emblemz message=68061470]Okay episode... Nothing really to talk about with animation or storyboard. Cut comedy is fine. Byakuya not dying will forever be Kubo&#039;s biggest fumble. Squad 0 are cool enough. 6/10[/quote]it not even his mistake that the female fans😂if he didnt that would have been a mess
"A pretty good episode. Kinda bummed they removed Mayuri&#039;s [spoiler][url=https://imgur.com/a/Xg7evZq]lore explanations[/url] about broken Bankai though[/spoiler]<br />
<br />
[i]Mod Edit: Added spoiler tags; please hide plot details.[/i]"
"Not killing Byakuya is for the best, instead of getting a *stare* from the Byakuya fans. He is one of the main supporting characters, removing him like that is a no-go, Rukia would be all alone... (⁠っ⁠˘̩⁠╭⁠╮⁠˘̩⁠)⁠っ<br />
<br />
Moving on. Another solid episode but as the others have stated, the pacing looks too fast but at the same time, for me, it was too slow or they simply skipped parts that I don&#039;t know of as a non-manga reader.<br />
<br />
Heck, even as a non-manga reader, I can readily understand the story quite well since I already watched the previous season with a serious mind, to understand every character including the supporting ones quite well but of course, probably some others won&#039;t really have a knack for it or most probably, they really didn&#039;t try to understand the story. (Try rewatching the old seasons again before you watch this series... lmao)<br />
<br />
P.S. Byakuya getting tossed around like that was hilarious for some reason lmao"
"even though the action has dropped a bit, it was still number one good episode"
Finally we get to see the zero squad.....and it&#039;s really nice to see Ginjou and the gang and my man Grimmjow is back......
byakuya survived im soo happy!! the episode was hilarious. cant wait to see unohana in action. will we get to see more of the og gotei 13? i really loved the special ed featuring them. kinda disappointed that they switched back to the old version ed. But the song slaps
I wanted to see that rukia booty scene in the bath... oh well I guess Ill have to be content with seeing her at all ! 😍
"another amazing ep<br />
byakyua is alive<br />
and squad zero have been animated finally"
"now there&#039;s also zero squad ok<br />
and soul king wake up nice"
"After nonstop action since the beginning of the season it&#039;s about time we got a breather. Obviously the mood is depressing in Soul Society right now, with all the injuries/casualties and the captains grieving Old Man Yama, but Squad Zero was finally introduced and they&#039;re certainly an interesting, humorous, and colorful collection of people. Glad they kind of lightened the mood of this episode a bit. It was also nice to see a lot of old familiar faces again (especially a certain someone that was teased during the Urahara conversation)."
"[quote=JediSZN message=68061678]Anyone like the additional scenes Kubo added in this episode? Like them mentioning Isshin saying &ldquo;Even if it makes Uncle sad&rdquo; as well as them showing Ginjo and the others earlier? I don&rsquo;t think I remember seeing that in the manga. <br />
<br />
This episode was slower, as to be expected, but overall amazing just like the rest![/quote]<br />
Ginjo and the others were in the manga"
"Quite the turn of events. Characters I thought I&#039;d never see again came out of nowhere. But, before all of that. It&#039;s not the best look Soul Society. Everything is destroyed, most of the squad members are death and only one squad remains full. Byakuga and Kenpachi might never regain consciousness, but they&#039;re atleast not dead. Rukia and the rest are hurt, but not in a critical condition like the rest. Ichigo&#039;s the only one who seems to be doing fine after fighting Yhwach. Oh man, this is where the turn of events starts. Squad Zero who serves under the Soul King appeared and took a handful of soul reapers with them and one of them was Ichigo. The one woman&#039;s design is just cheff kiss, can&#039;t stop looking at her. And the other dude with the Yakuza hair cut is hilarious imo. Really like characters like this who kinda bring up a bit more comedy into series. Aside from that, we got a fatty who seems to be the leader type. You&#039;ve also got the reintroductions of the main antagonists of the last Bleach arc and our boy (whose name I forgot).<br />
The Soul King appeared in the end and I must say, he does look very godly."
"This episode definitely felt like the old Bleach. I&rsquo;m for sure glad of the new changes and update of Bleach it was needed, but the colors and humor made me feel like I was watching some older episodes. I still do believe Byakuya should&rsquo;ve died, but it&rsquo;s all cool. Probably my favorite arc of Bleach and it looks like they&rsquo;re gonna expand and foreshadow a lot of it. Good episode"
"Mild spoilers for manga:<br />
I wonder what the point of showing [spoiler]Giriko if he just magically dissapears and does exactly NOTHING later in the manga. Maybe it&#039;s for the best to not show him at all instead of mindlessly copying frames to the screen... or I am completely wrong and he WILL show up later? Would be cool if that&#039;s the case[/spoiler] "
"Pacing was way too fast again and scenes just transitioned into others without leaving the audience enough time to process what was happening. How the hell are non-manga followers keeping up when the anime keeps moving a hundred miles a minute?<br />
<br />
 Also the studio missed a great opportunity to actually give Oetsu some more dialogue yet he was basically ignored just like in the manga. Also they chose a really weird place to end the episode. "
It&#039;s nice to see Grimmjow back again !!
"3/5<br />
<br />
A severe drop in direction and pacing after the last 2 bleach episodes, arguably the best in the whole series so far. The animation still remains gorgeous but the pacing was very jarring and obtuse this time around<br />
<br />
We follow the aftermath of Quincies utter destruction of Soul society. Kenpachi, Byakuya, Rukia &amp; Renji are all relatively safe while Ichigo is in shambles as to what he just learned from Ywach, which was very short-lived. We then immediately get introduced to squad 0 outta nowhere and it felt a bit all over the pace. We get our usual interactions especially focusing more on Unohana, pretty excited for her reveal in upcoming episodes. <br />
<br />
It is then decided that Ichigo is to visit the soul palace immediately while we see a little tease of fan favorite Grimmjow. We also see a little bit of Ganzo and those guys from the fullbringer arc(I forgot their names). Ichigo has to go through every squad zero members like a rite of passage while Byakuya &amp; Kenpachi are healing. We get a little glimpse of what Soul King looks like at the end and his design is very interesting to say the least<br />
<br />
Again, even though the pacing and sequencing were all over the place, the episode is still jam packed with reveals, comedy and more reveals. <br />
"
"Good episode. Honestly I was happy they cut out the comedy, even when revisiting these chapters, I was just rolling my eyes at it lol fits since it&#039;s the aftermath of a storm. The animation was stunning."
"This is one heavily censored &amp; rushed episode! The studio cut out way too much lore and is rushing to the next big fight...<br />
- No steroid Kon<br />
- No Rukia&#039;s peaches<br />
- Bankai explanation cut short<br />
- Shinji was the one who operated on Renji and Ruki and saved their lives, and this is cut out<br />
- Urahara stealing the hot springs tech from Kirinji cut out<br />
- No explanation why Orihime can&#039;t just heal the captains and the broken bankais<br />
The Bleach subreddit has a very long list of the cut content for those interested."
"I hate to say it but i cant wait 1 week for the next episode this was so great.<br />
Good that byakuya and kenpachi are alive.<br />
We see for the first time the Squad Zero, they seem to be a lot more stronger then the 13 Squad Captains.<br />
<br />
Was there Ichigo dad in the past scene they shown."
They really screwed up the scene where Komamura lays out Soi fon.
"[quote=Okeanix message=68061561]There is 3 big problems with this anime with 2 coming from manga itself.<br />
<br />
1- Pacing<br />
<br />
Pacing is extremely fast, they cut too much and squeezing scenes to fit so much in one episode. There is no way non-manga readers can feel or understand anything at this point.<br />
<br />
2- Writing<br />
<br />
Writing was always bad in Bleach because Tite Kubo is bad writer. Soul Society Arc was his best. There was no reason to Byakuya survive but he survives anyway.<br />
<br />
3- Worldbuilding<br />
<br />
Worldbuilding doesn&#039;t make sense even from the first episode, there is no correlation between anything, there is no reason, explanation, how this works, how that works etc. etc. [/quote]<br />
What&rsquo;re you talking about? I haven&rsquo;t read the manga and I understand everything that&rsquo;s been happening just fine. And Bleach has pretty good worldbuilding with rich history between the characters which was on display in this episode with how characters interacted with each other between captains who&rsquo;re vizards and who weren&rsquo;t, Squad 0 and the 13 Court Squads, and some teacher and student history. The history is so rich with characters having their own stories outside of Ichigo. I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with Byakuya living cuz he&rsquo;s a popular character and it&rsquo;s not like nobody died or something."
"Good episode, we were introduced to squad zero!<br />
Ichibei looks really good and i&#039;m looking forward to see Oh-Etsu! A bit sad that they removed Kon&#039;s buff form but it&#039;s a minor detail.:&#039;( <br />
<br />
7.5/10 episode"
"Watching this episode feels like watching Bleach in the past, it&#039;s really very nostalgic to see the humor in this episode. I&#039;m also happy to see that the squad 0 character doesn&#039;t look like a strong character but is actually very strong. Another good thing is that many of the old characters that I thought were dead are seen coming back in this episode. I really enjoyed this episode can&#039;t wait to see the next episode.<br />
<br />
Really Good Episode 5/5"
"No Rukia peach is a big shame, rest of the episode was solid, but probably the weakest one in this whole season so far, even if it&#039;s kinda forgivable after three banger episodes (5,6,7) in a row.<br />
<br />
Next episode&#039;s title is &quot;The Drop&quot;, guessing it will end with the introduction of [spoiler]Zaraki vs Unohana[/spoiler] and the full fight will be EP10. If they do it right, that&#039;s another amazing episode right there and could even compare to the previous mentioned peak of the season.<br />
<br />
7/10."
This was a great set up episode after the last 2 awesome episodes. Oh the tease of Kenpachi at the end was a nice touch!
"They need to stop adding post-credit scenes tbh. They&#039;re very easy to miss and there&#039;s really no point in adding them. I had enough of that shit when FMAB did it.<br />

The close up panel of rage captured his emotions well. Here they just panned out so we saw the entire hall for some reason while he was yelling which completely ruined the moment. Then again the entire episode cut corners like that."

That wasn&#039;t really Kubo&#039;s fault, he was pressured a lot with death threats from Byakuya fanboys, and while is sad that he kept him alive in the anime, I wouldn&#039;t say it was a fumble, it&#039;s sad how much power some salty fanboys have over someone&#039;s work. [/quote]<br />
That&#039;s been a baseless rumor floating around but no one has ever verified that(even back when chapters were coming out). Hell, Kubo got death threats other times before and that never influenced his writing."
nice introduction
the ep was good and i wanted to see rio more 
Now the grim task of search and rescue and Id&#039;ing the dead begins huh. Even if the 4th&#039;s healers were on the front the quincies assault would have caused losses to them as well. Putting the needs of others before himself is what we live about him after all. As if losing the head captain wasn&#039;t tragic enough but not even having a body to bury as well. Hmm so squad zero is a squad of captains that have the fighting power of the whole of the squads huh. If only they were on the field when the enemy attacked. Still they sure are quite the eccentric bunch. Still must be nice for them to all have castles of their own though when they&#039;re in their realm. Overall a fun ep that did a great job at showing not only how much damage the society took but also how many reapers lost their lives or were horribly injured during the enemy assault. Im curious at what squad zero would bring to the story though.

I trust Kubo, and I know this final arc specifically was hell for him due to deadlines and health issues, so him being affected by death threats is very plausible even if he had received death threats in the past."
"Even after the few very heavy eps we got before it&#039;s nice to see the usual comedy back, the Squad Zero had a pretty fun introduction I would say xD"
Squad Zero finally appeared
Great to see some familiar faces along with some new characters.  It&#039;s crazy to see Ganju back in action plus the royal palace seems interesting.  I hope the royal palace is as cool as I expect it to be.
"Only a short moment of Kukaku, would&#039;ve liked more screen time for her<br />
<br />
Squad zero dropping in, but Senjumaru is the only one that I find interesting"
Very good episode and I love squad 0 designs

"As if defeating Yamamoto wasn&#039;t enough, Yhwach disrespecting him and his leadership over the years and then seeming to leave without a care in the world just rubbed a whole bowl of salt into the wound.<br />
<br />
But.. but what awaited us just a couple of minutes later was the jaw-dropping return of fucking Ichigo in Soul Society. Him appearing out of thin air and then that Byakuya convo hitting the right notes throughout was nothing short of a perfect way to symbolize the despair soul society went through before him coming back there. And did they go all-out adapting his and Yhwach&rsquo;s face-off? Heck yeah.<br />
<br />
Yhwach leaving after putting thousands of thoughts in Ichigo&#039;s mind.. as far as calling him his son born in darkness. Things are already set up for plenty of plot points coming together in future. And yeah ED with OG Gotei 13 in it."
"A sad episode indeed... It was sad to see old man Yamamoto being disrespected like that but even after all that his body was standing. And... this episode was a lot more brutal as well. RIP Byakuya as well. Feelsbadman for so many characters. Ichigo&#039;s rage is very well shown and his encounter with Yhwach is also done in an excellent way. <br />
<br />
The best thing about this episode was the OST. Shiro Sagisu is once again not disappointing anyone. Really enjoyed this episode. The new visuals for the ED were beautiful."
"The way they used one of the iconic sad theme music for this episode made it all more impactful. <br />
<br />
Goodbye Yamamoto...in these past few episodes and this one, we&#039;ve grown to know you on a more emotional level than any of the previous arcs. Not going to lie, watching Ichigo&#039;s fight with that music and soundtrack was tough. It&#039;s crazy to see the power gap between him and Yhwach."
"The pre OP scene with the og gotei 13 was lit af.<br />
<br />
RIP Yamamoto, RIP Byakuya, RIP all the dead members of soul society. I teared up watching the current state of soul society.<br />
<br />
So Ichigo has quincy powers, his mother was a quincy eh.<br />
<br />
Episode 7 special ED:<br />
[yt]1YSLo3D7hyw[/yt]"
"After such a fire episode with Yamamoto vs Ychwah, I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying this, but this one was even better than the last. Absolutely fantastic direction and music, 10/10 episode for sure and easily one of the best Bleach episodes to date.<br />
<br />
They&#039;re really going all in with this adaptation. If they mantain the level of quality of this first part in the following cours, Bleach fans are eating REALLY good for the next 2 years."
"Seriously, how did they manage to make this episode even better than the last one?<br />
This one was probably the best yet in terms of additional scenes, it made everything more impactful. There is a flashback scene with the OG Gotei 13. ALSO, AIZEN CHANGED YHWACH&#039;S SENSE OF TIME JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM, you gotta love this dude, man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please protect the Soul Society, Kurosaki Ichigo.&quot;<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/j2NK6KH.png[/img]"
"Amazing episode with extended content <br />
Really liked the atmosphere"
"That first scene, just magnificent. Completely anime original. Thanks so much Kubo for that extra information missing from the manga! The original 13 court guard squads really didn&#039;t mess around.<br />
<br />
Rest in peace, old man Yamamoto. You deserved some rest after all this time.<br />
<br />
Ichigo is part Quincy too it seems. He really is the full package. Part everything, haha. Imagine how strong he will be once he manages to make use of those Quincy powers. Ichigo&#039;s mother in involved somehow and Yhwach called Ichgo his son? Dun dun dun! The mystery builds. <br />
<br />
Even after Byakuya&#039;s motivational speech, Ichigo still got manhandled. Not as badly as Aizen&#039;s finger move, but perhaps more brutal. The fight was well animated though and the music used was great.<br />
<br />
Aizen apparently was able to use his hypnosis on Yhwach just by Yhwach looking at him, which is quite the flex, considering that Yhwach probably never witnessed Aizen release his Shikai. So that must mean that Aizen got even more powerful since getting locked up, which is insane.<br />
<br />
The Soul Society really took a big loss in this first fight, but it&#039;s not as terrible as it could have been. I even made a graph.<br />
<br />
Red=Definitely dead. <br />
Orange=Injured, may or may not be dead. <br />
Green=Alive and well for all we know.<br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/QRhbZif.png[/img]<br />
<br />
With this might seem pretty even, one thing to keep in mind in Yamamoto was as strong as the other Soul Reapers combined, so him dying is a big loss. Another thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of the no name Shinigami were taken out as well. And lastly, Yamamoto and Kenpachi did most of the work themselves, haha.<br />

<br />
and the action is great <br />

Ichigo learns hes a Quincy too due to his mother being a Quincy so he is half Quincy and half Shinigami [/quote]<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not really filler seeing how Kubo is involved, I saw the leak earlier and I think they said we might get a Bleach prequel series"
"The episodes keep on getting better the adaption is so good, I&#039;m so happy kubo is working close with the studio because they are killing it "
"This was better than the previous episode for me, can confidently state that. Direction was really good, animation was on point and a nice reveal there at the end with Ichigo&#039;s mother there too. The original content too added to this series and the pacing was generally really solid here. Wasn&#039;t in love with the music at the start but it got better and better by the end."

ye i just like to call it fillers since its not in the manga anyway even if its the original author adding them<br />

"Bleach delivering banger episodes back to back. No wonder its the best anime this fall. Loved the new ED visuals.<br />
<br />
[quote=anime-prime message=68013290]That first scene, just magnificent. Completely anime original. Thanks so much Kubo for that extra information missing from the manga! The original 13 court guard squads really didn&#039;t mess around.<br />
<br />
Rest in peace, old man Yamamoto. You deserved some rest after all this time.<br />
<br />
Ichigo is part Quincy too it seems. He really is the full package. Part everything, haha. Imagine how strong he will be once he manages to make use of those Quincy powers. Ichigo&#039;s mother in involved somehow and Yhwach called Ichgo his son? Dun dun dun! The mystery builds. <br />
<br />
Even after Byakuya&#039;s motivational speech, Ichigo still got manhandled. Not as badly as Aizen&#039;s finger move, but perhaps more brutal. The fight was well animated though and the music used was great.<br />
<br />
Aizen apparently was able to use his hypnosis on Yhwach just by Yhwach, which is quite the flex, considering that Yhwach probably never witnessed Aizen release his Shikai. So that must mean that Aizen got even more powerful since getting locked up, which is insane.<br />
<br />
The Soul Society really took a big loss in this first fight, but it&#039;s not as terrible as it could have been. I even made a graph.<br />
<br />
Red=Definitely dead. <br />
Orange=Injured, may or may not be dead. <br />
Green=Alive and well for all we know.<br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/QRhbZif.png[/img]<br />
<br />
With this might seem pretty even, one thing to keep in mind in Yamamoto was as strong as the other Soul Reapers combined, so him dying is a big loss. Another thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of the no name Shinigami were taken out as well. And lastly, Yamamoto and Kenpachi did most of the work themselves, haha.<br />
<br />
Also made a list of the revealed Sternritter Shrifts and names for what have been confirmed in the anime so far.<br />

I still haven&#039;t decided if I will add these every episode or not, but I figured that now that the so called first invasion ended and all the fighting is over for now, that this would be a great place to show a recap of sorts of what we know about the enemy abilities and the casualties that took place on both sides. <br />

Couldn&#039;t hold my shit from last episode yet and this is go even further can&#039;t wait for kenpachi fight
Can&#039;t wait for the next episode I need to know what Yhwach meant when he said my son...
"Capt. Yamamoto and Byakuya weren&#039;t wrong about not wanting pulling humans to their problems. <br />
<br />
Was a great scene the Ichigo and Byakuya heart-to-heart.<br />
<br />
Cool fight , but the basic trope to lose the fight, to then win later on.<br />
<br />
Ah yes, the info that made a handful of people to dislike Bleach back in the day: Ichigo is a Quincy too.<br />
<br />
Im puzzled that one of the original Gotei 13 looks like that Loly Aivirrne Arrancar. The haircut and the lack of an eye same side.  "
"Please stop, I can&#039;t stand the power of the fighting clips and the fierce war, thank you very much, we are living in our best time"
"Holy shit&hellip;. This episode is somehow just as good as Ep 6.<br />
 (Maybe better)  The choreography and fluidity is incredible as is the animation and dare I say maybe even better.  The Sakuga is on point.<br />
<br />
Kubo is a genius and we have won!<br />
<br />
The added content, the emotion and atmosphere, the despair and depression of the deaths, the vibe of utter destruction is unbelievably perfect.  They gave us even more of the past and actually making Sasakibe worth something and a badass in wonderful.  This is a masterpiece.  To all people doubting Bleach anime Ep 6 and this episode should solidify that we are in impeccable hands.  They really know how to capture it all and I am amazed and impressed.<br />
<br />
Words cant describe how happy I am.  This has to be the best anime adaptation.  Anime of the year no question.  The GOAT."
Im at 4.6 squeepigs and squeeppigs keep hitting the fan
"Bleach sits on the throne of anime, it is the feeling of pleasure and enthusiasm"
"Made a new entry just for episode 7 Alone. My mind is blown, I don&#039;t recall much of the manga here, but I can say for sure that many things shown, especially the OG Gotei 13 were anime original.<br />
<br />
This episode was hugely emotional and boy, I can say it rivals Episode 6, it might be even better, the OST, the emotional weight, the damn peak animation, it got me even more pumped than the previous episode.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad they showed a bit of the old Gotei 13, I&#039;d love if we receive a spin off or more flashbacks about them, because holy shit that was brutal. Also that cutscene between Adult Yama and young Shunsui was a nice addition too.<br />
<br />
We then see Yamamoto&#039;s last stance and the second part of the invasion in which is a complete total slaughter, Shinigamis being destroyed from left ro right, while a powerless Ichigo is standing there sensing their souls fade as he can&#039;t do much but spam getsuga tenshou until the jail breaks. And after this, we&#039;re met with a huge emotional scene with the last moments of Byakuya, ngl this was devastating, all those dead shinigami sights must have been really taxing on Ichigo, especially those dear friends of his, and now Byakuya basically giving him his last will on protecting Soul Society, they really delivered and give the manga justice on this scene, you could feel Ichigo&#039;s anger from far away and Morita&#039;s voice was on a whole &#039;nother level, and then, the icing on the cake was the fight between Ichigo and Yhwach which was short, but it was damn amazing.<br />
<br />
What a banger episode, I think I&#039;d need to rewatch this episode just to be sure. The ost was amazing, the animation was pretty good despite the CG on the soldats, the fight choreography was damn insane, and the passion in the voice acting, holy shit. I&#039;m speechless, what a time to be a Bleach Fan!"
Omfg I didn&rsquo;t think episode 6 could be topped but my god 7 was amazing.
"unohana looks so good at the start<br />
rip Yamamoto<br />
and I really hope Byakuya isn&#039;t dead<br />
all the captains got destroyed...<br />
cant wait for the next ep <br />
"

"I can say that the return of the elders makes the new anime just drops of water that disappear with the sunrise, thanks Bleach"
JUST PEAK ITS JUST PEAK THE VFX VOICE ACTING ACTION EVERYTHING TOO DAMN GOOD
Another solid episode. Overall the anime is way better than the manga even if Yhwach is still ridiculously overpowered at every point in TYBW. If Pierrot keeps this level of production for the 2nd invasion and the Kubo rewrites are actually good then this adaptation will be somewhat worth the hype. Still overrated but better than I imagined.
"I have utter chills man. They did this episode magnificently. Yamamoto&#039;s and Shunsui&#039;s flashback, Byakuya scene, Ichigo&#039;s fight against Yhwach, the quincies absolutely destroying the SS, the OG GOTEI 13! Just incredible. I&#039;ll have to rewatch.<br />

"I had a lot of qualms with the direction of the previous episode, but this episode proved that they&#039;re still on the right track! This felt exactly how Bleach should feel. Big props to [url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=169990]Shinichirō Ueda[/url] for his direction in this episode -- they must be a fan of the show themselves because they knew how to hit all the right, familiar notes. I honestly enjoyed this a hundred times more than the previous episode, and I can now safely say that my faith in this adaptation has been restored once more.<br />
<br />
Some random notes:<br />
[list]<br />
[*]Everyone&#039;s already seen the &#039;leaked&#039; picture of the former Gotei 13 captains, so seeing them like this wasn&#039;t a huge surprise, but it was cool nonetheless! I hope we get even more backstory on them in the future.<br />
[*]I love how they showed Chōjirō and Yamamoto teaming up to take down Yhwach.<br />
[*]Yamamoto&#039;s death was depressingly beautiful. You could hear the grief in Shunsui&#039;s voice when he shouted out his name. That was sad as fuck.<br />
[*]Perfect selection of soundtracks in this episode. My nostalgia bone is hurting.<br />

[b]EDIT[/b]: If I may add one criticism: I didn&#039;t like how many flashing lights the Yhwach VS Ichigo fight had. I&#039;m a migraineur myself so that kind of shit is painful for me to look at. And for people with epilepsy, it&#039;s so much worse. So, if you somehow haven&#039;t watched the episode yet, consider this a [color=red][b]friendly flashing lights warning.[/b][/color]"
"Another masterfully animated episode how can they keep this quality... Anime exclusive scenes, animation was gorgeous, BLEACH SEASON "
"That was a ridiculous plot twist, lol... (unfortunately, I already got spoiled by some dumb*ss from another thread)<br />
Well, this was enjoyable enough but I&#039;m still unsatisfied. I need more episodes lmao.<br />

"The opening scene with the original 13 was glorious!<br />
<br />
edit: It tookd me a few hours to digest. I almost cried when Byakuya died. I feel widowed. He was my future ex animated husband.<br />

Now, I&#039;m wondering if Ichi&#039;s mom wasn&#039;t Yhwach (how do they get Yuhabaha out of that?) daughter."
episode felt like it was 30 seconds long. it was over too soon. so is ichigo part quincy or something?
best one till now. also original gotei 13 dope
"[b]To everyone who thinks Ichigo using Blut Vene is an &quot;ass-pull&quot;, or makes no sense[/b], I promise you that it will all be explained later in a satisfying way. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything, but there&#039;s more to this besides Ichigo just randomly awakening a new ability at a convenient time. It won&#039;t be brushed over. Once you have all the pieces of the puzzle, it will make sense.<br />

There [i]are[/i] problems in the writing of this arc (which I hope the anime adaptation will correct), but trust me, this is not one of them."

it&#039;s arguably the  only  explanation that makes sense for  Ichigo&#039;s &quot;part everything&quot; nonsense in this manga.  If they took the hollow side and fullbringer side out he would be much more fleshed out, since the shinigami and  the quincy are  the only ones  that make practical sense considering their origins.  "
"Calling this episode a perfect adaptation is an understatement, it flat out elevated the manga with stuff we&#039;ve always wanted to see"
"HOLY FUCK! they weren&#039;t lying about the extends. Pierrot just went ufotable mode when Ichigo was fighting Yhwach. I don&#039;t remember it being in the manga . Also, the original Gotei 13 in the start was soo good .I guess this was the extends they were talking about. By looking at Byakuya I guess he will die in anime which will be correct decision.100/10 episode. Plus Shiro Sagisu&#039;s music just made everything 100x better .Never saw Studio Pierrot do this much justice to an anime adaptation. The studio infamous to ruin a manga did this masterpiece of an episode.<br />
BEST EPISODE TILL NOW"
"Even better then 10/10 ep 6 for me, this is just crazy, we are eating good."
&quot;Nothing can be explained.&quot;
"This was yet another 10/10 episode, and maybe even better than last week, which I didn&#039;t think was possible. The animation for Ichigo vs. Yhwach was incredible, and the Quincy reveal was a crazy twist. The original 13 Squad Captains were ruthless. It was sad to hear how heartbroken Shunsui was over Yamamoto&#039;s death, you can tell how much the old man meant to him. And RIP Byakuya (if he&#039;s actually dead), I grew to like him a lot after the SS arc, and his speech to Ichigo was very touching."
Perfection 🔥🔥damn it it was better than previous episode maybe bcs i wasnt huped but god damn it broke my expactations
Goddman what an episode
Great Episode. Yama&#039;s Death was so sad and Ichigo&#039;s return to Soul Society was awesome. The conversation between Byakuya and Ichigo was adapted well in the anime. Ichigo vs Yhwach fight animation was out of this world. Waiting for more episodes like this.

<br />
Yeah the Quincy part is probably the one with the best explanation"
"Somehow they managed to outdo their work from episode 6. Loved the anime-original scenes with the OG 13 Court Guard Squads, and overall the emotions were high in this episode. Every captain realizing Old Man Yama was defeated, and Shunsui&#039;s reaction in particular, was heartbreaking. The Ichigo/Byakuya conversation hit hard too, and we got THE panel!!!! Save the Soul Society, Ichigo Kurosaki 😭<br />
<br />
The Ichigo-Yhwach fight was great too and a new revelation about Ichigo has now been teased by Yhwach. Too bad he took his leave but he planted the seeds that will lead to interesting questions and even more interesting answers. "

<br />
That&#039;s the first cour. We&#039;ll have 4 cours of 13 ep each"
"Nah this episode was filthy. The animation and fight scene were top notch. The ost&#039;s were perfect too. This took the source material and enhanced it, a perfect adaptation so far, if not better than the manga."
peak as always!!!!!!
"This was arguably as amazing as the previous episode, maybe even better and more impactful in one way or another. Direction and animation continues to be solid and on point. The shifting to the feeling of despair and loss of hope due to the head captain Yamamoto biting the dust and Soul Society being pushed to the brink of death. The heavy atmosphere and beautifully depressing OST. I really don&#039;t know how to break this down properly at all. Ichigo&#039;s rage and frustration can be truly be felt here thanks to the endeavors of Morita&#039;s top-notch voice acting, and I wasn&#039;t expecting the really cool-looking animated sequence with Ichigo vs Yhwach. Sadly the former was running on an empty gas tank due to physically and mentally exhausting himself trying to break out of Quilge&#039;s prison.<br />
<br />
The reveal with Ichigo&#039;s awakened Quincy powers and the reference to his past mother was really nice as well and serves as a key story element going forward, and honestly doesn&#039;t feel like something inserted as some thoughtless plot device. However, the biggest part of this episode was that first few minutes of anime-original content featuring the original Gotei 13, which not even the light novels even covered, from what I was told. I really liked the monotone old film grain effect utilized here to depict it as a key historical moment for the entire story of Bleach. The new ED visuals featuring Kubo&#039;s art of them was also another great present. Such an emotionally loaded and somber episode, as well as even more added material to flesh out the story that Kubo intended, and I believe this adaptation is only gonna get better from here now out, even if it does run into some minor setbacks along the way.<br />
<br />
[yt]1YSLo3D7hyw[/yt]"
Peak. Never seen anything better
"So ichigos mom was a quicy then is he also a quicy well we see that in the next episodes.<br />
Holy that fight was so amazing and the Animation was top. Looks like Rukia and Renji are not good  thats good to hear. What will now happen in the Soul Society.<br />
The moment where ichigo was in rage and the OST that was so nice and impactful.<br />
<br />
Rest in Peace Byakuya."
I really like that they included the first gotei 13 at the first part of the episode and the War a thousand years ago.

"Damn! What a cracker!<br />
Watching the episode in between FIFA World Cup matches and this is firing up!<br />
<br />
[b]It broke my heart hearing Byakuya&#039;s soft voice with lots of regret and sadness[/b]"
it was really good and I think the stark before the opening was really cool
really good animation and the music great as well
"The action , conversation and musical synergy is just out of the box for this episode. Really good at building atmospheric tension."
"[quote=anime-prime message=68013290]The Soul Society really took a big loss in this first fight, but it&#039;s not as terrible as it could have been. I even made a graph.<br />
<br />
Red=Definitely dead.<br />
Orange=Injured, may or may not be dead.<br />
Green=Alive and well for all we know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With this might seem pretty even, one thing to keep in mind in Yamamoto was as strong as the other Soul Reapers combined, so him dying is a big loss. Another thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of the no name Shinigami were taken out as well. And lastly, Yamamoto and Kenpachi did most of the work themselves, haha.[/quote]<br />

"People should abide by the rules, like you don&#039;t interfere when the main bosses from both parties go one-on-one. Moreover we talking about people like Yamamoto and Yhwach. The conversation alone was so hype worthy that even if they didn&#039;t do nothing otherwise, it still would&#039;ve been plenty enough.<br />
<br />
The biggest fight and hence the biggest moment, witnessing the BANKAI of Yamamoto, Zanka no Tachi. It can reduce any fucking thing straight to ashes, and you bet it did. The absolute overwhelmingness of its powers made Yhwach look like a kid throwing a fit, moreover the iconic undead army making their presence was just the final nail in the coffin.<br />
<br />
Except things didn&rsquo;t end there and what welcomed us was an earth-shattering plot twist. Yhwach being the fake one aka Sternritter &lsquo;Y&rsquo; all along. And what followed was the ultimate demise of Yamamoto. Rest in peace, Yama-Jii, with all due respect.<br />
<br />
An episode for the ages. Thanks a lot Pierrot, y&rsquo;all did everything justice. Plus that anime-original conversation between Yhwach and Aizen was just the cherry on the cake*chef&rsquo;s kiss*"
"Well it&rsquo;s been a thousand years since Yhwach and Yamamoto had some past (from Yamamoto&rsquo;s own reminiscent) and now the present seems like their anticipation for the survival of the fittest from this mere fight alone. Flame all over it&rsquo;s bring up some tension but oh boy Yamamoto at first hand is already in the deed when the group of quincies started coming over, bringing some interference and unfairness into the fight, but after some quick dispose, it continues until Yhwach could possibly shatter Yamamoto&rsquo;s blade, soul and flesh, huh he must be putting his blood, sweat and tears into this. Overall fight sequence is one of the best that this season has to offer so far because holy I was on the edge of my seat. <br />
<br />
Yamamoto&rsquo;s bankai scene on the other hand put a lit on the candle with a true statement that can&rsquo;t be said better. Heh few of the Gotei 13 members seem to have problems with their skin, like typically it may be due to water scarcity of the whole society after Yamamoto unleashes his Bankai. 15m degrees is a BIG temperature, well at least Yamamoto can bear even getting near close to the sun, he&rsquo;s kinda intense when taking a whole risk when Yhwach said that this quincy is a pain in the ass. Skulls all over the place 💀💀💀 I couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing with the mixed cg on it even when it still looks eerie, reminds me so much of Berserk after looking at this from the color palette.. Well ngl Yhwach got me in the first half because obviously any fucking antagonist who had a quarter of a screentime can&rsquo;t fall for such atrocious. Well farewell Yamamoto, you will be missed &lt;/3 Soul society will be in a huge burden without him ig. <br />
"
"BANKAI: ZANKA NO TACHI<br />
<br />
Wow... what an amazing fight that was. The animation and direction were great. They added some scenes and I&#039;m glad that they did. It made things quite impactful. It&#039;s no wonder they&#039;re so afraid of Yamamoto. Incredible episode. Also, loved seeing a little bit of Aizen, the GOAT.<br />
<br />
In the end, Yhawch was the last one standing because of his witty decisions in that fight. It&#039;s gonna be hell to handle after Yamamoto. Feels Bad Man..."
"Fighting Yamamoto in this arc is like fighting off a pissed off super boss. He&#039;s not in the best of mood with that nuclear like attitude.<br />
<br />
Yamamoto vs Yhwach is fun to watch, when watching two leaders face off. Yamamoto&#039;s burning passion represents his desire to not just revenge but protect Soul Society. Not going to lie but Yhwach has some pretty cool moves himself. <br />
<br />
And...AIZEN IS BACK!"
"The animation was crazy indeed, good sign that they&rsquo;re willing to do those in important episodes. <br />
<br />
I did feel like the character designs were very different through the fluid sequences, but that&rsquo;s fine. The choreography was not my favorite, but I need to rewatch it to judge.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact that Yamamoto was tricked also pisses me off, I would like him to be simply overpowered and not tricked into lose.<br />
<br />
Aizen scene was also really good!<br />
<br />
Anyways, great episode overall 9/10"
"I&#039;ve always loved this particular stage of Zanka no Tachi, it reminds me of something out of a Junji Ito horror manga. <br />
CGI in the episode was expected, as it&#039;s a much easier way to animate all these skeletons.<br />
<br />
This was one of the best anime episodes I&#039;ve seen - and I&#039;ve seen many, but I&#039;m a Bleach fan so I&#039;m most likely being biased as well.<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/rocpPwO.png[/img]"
Finally seeing Zanka no tachi getting animated and I am so damn happy right now. Volume 57 was the first bleach volume that I had bought and seeing Yama&#039;s Bankai so early in such a badass way literally gave me goosebumps. The anime just nailed it.
"best episode in the series yet. Rest In Peace Yama, you&#039;ll be missed. This episode was SOOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
As always... BLEAChads cant stop winning. PEAK shounen
"Best episode so far!<br />
Yamato vs Yhwach might be my favorite fight from Bleach and seeing it animated was amazing!<br />
And next episode is going to be great as well!"
there are people who hated this episode.Bravo pure Bleach haters.
An amazing episode with amazing animation and cgi done really well. AIZENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
"Yhwach played the ultimate uno reverse card<br />
<br />
Still, in terms of charisma he got nothing on Aizen. He owned their little chat. Hope he returns to the battlefield."
"I fucking love Yamamoto&#039;s bankai. Holy shit, the conversation between Yhwach and Yamamoto was crazy. Espically if you think about it, it&#039;s been almost a thousand years since they&#039;ve communicated with each other. Man, Pierriot did an insane job this episode. The fucking skulls too LOL... At to make it better, Aizen is fucking BACK."
"Ooh boy.. this felt like a movie, and I&#039;m not talking just about the animation here. To have the Aizen scene wrap up the story of this massive threat that has descended upon the Soul Society and the waterfall from Yamamoto&#039;s bankai is... incredible storytelling and story framing from Kubo everyone who worked on this episode. <br />
<br />
What an incredible journey. I feel shivers."
"Yamamoto&#039;s bankai looked sick in this episode, animators pulled out the big guns here for that and the action in this episode for the most part. Don&#039;t think it was a masterpiece episode or close to that for me, but it was cool to see Bleach not pull back visually with the action here. Q Kawa and Hiroyuki Yamashita worked on this episode too among many talented animators so that level of talent does reflect on the episode too. CGI skeletons were meh but I can understand why they went with them, not too big a deal for me. It was nice seeing Aizen again too here."
"Now that was worthy of big 3 Bleach!<br />
<br />
that shit that was intense as fuck!"
"Good episode.<br />
<br />
Btw if you will pay attention to Ending Credits You&#039;lll Notice at 23:04 Ryan White.<br />
<br />
He is known as Retro Ryno who has done some fan animations [including &quot;1st&quot; episode of TYBW fan animation] for years and some people already argued that his animation &quot;is better&quot; than official As Nodt vs Byakuya. So what will be the argument of that kind of people when you see him in end credits of official episode?<br />
<br />
Be aware of checking his other videos as he has done some little shorts of stuff which will happen in 2nd/3rd cour.<br />

<br />
Episode was great, I&#039;d wish the skeleton scene was better but it still gave away the mood and feeling which was most important here. "
Such an amazing ep!! 🔥🔥 shitt man!! Just straight heat!!
"I was hearing a lot of rumors and buzz surrounding the awaited episode 6 of this season, and boy did it deliver on the hype. The action in this episode, from seeing Yamamoto&#039;s Bankai in action to the actual fight animation, was nothing short of amazing. As OP as Yamamoto was though, Yhwach gained the upper hand by tricking him and managed to steal his Bankai and deal a fatal blow. I guess trickery and deceit is the only way you can overcome power as raw as Yamamoto&#039;s. RIP to the old gramps, what a fucking episode. And seeing the goat Aizen for a brief couple minutes was the icing on the cake to an already great episode. "
"Amazing visuals ✅<br />
Incredible sakuga ✅<br />

"One of the greatest anime episodes of all time, i have been waiting awhile for genruyasais bankkai to get animated<br />
"
"BANKAI! ZANKA NO TACHI! AFTER ALL THESE YEARS UT FINALLY GOT ANIMATED! 10/10 EPISODE. <br />
I love thise Uryu extends and AIZEN IS BACK!!!"
"Just in those minutes that Capt. Yamamoto was active, those who didn&#039;t died from the wounds already, died from dehydration.<br />
<br />
To catch a legendary pokemon you need to weaken them fist.<br />
<br />
Of course Aizen would join Yhwach, Aizen is his own boss.<br />
<br />
Aizen is well and doing a Evangelion cosplay."
"Yamamoto is a monster, holy sh*t!! But unfortunately that was an imposter Yhwach.<br />
<br />
Everything about this episode is amazing. Aesthetic, CG blend, animation and choreography. 5/5"
"Best episode in anime history, Best fight ever."
"To think we&#039;d finally see Zanka no Tachi fully animated after so many years. I&#039;ve gotta admit, I do remember South due to the those fell by Yamamoto, but damn the other ones are still amazing and very imposing.<br />
<br />
Gotta love the choreography in the battle, it went smoothly. Yamamoto is a beast ngl. Unfortunately we all got jebaited here, RIP Yamamoto.<br />
<br />
Ishida looking into the journal as he reads the story while the fight unfolds was a neat detail.<br />
<br />
Gotta watch this episode again later with better quality to fully appreciate the animation (and good subtitles too)"
"Not gonna lie, Yamamoto looked like a bit of a fool there. He was way too confident in his power (kind of understandable), and blinded by anger. Yhwach played his cards perfectly. The Soul Society is in complete shambles right now. You have to seriously wonder how they&#039;re gonna get out of this mess. "
"when I read the manga I could legit feel yamamoto&#039;s flames all around my body like the fight was so well done, and I knew that when this gets animated it would blow up all over the internet, and I think its safe to say that it DID NOT DISSAPOINT anybody, ofcourse the animation could still improve cuz those CGI skeletons made me laugh kinda hard but thats not all that important and so overall I rate this episode a solid 10 with this being the highest rated episode of this season on my list."
"Jesus christ <br />
<br />
WTF was that, this episode was so fucking good"
"that was a fire ep<br />
Yamamoto is way too op<br />
and so is yhwach<br />
<br />
I hope Yamamoto doesn&#039;t die<br />
amazing episode "
Incredible episode with superb direction and animation and is a contender for my favorite anime episode this year
The visuals and animation gave me goosebumps holyshit! glad i survive this long to witness this masterpiece 
10/10 BEST episode of bleach am speechless
"Absolute. F*cking. Fire. <br />
<br />
Yamamoto is such a badass. The most badass fire user there is. Zanka no Tachi did not disappoint, it was really intense. I also love the direction and flashbacks this episode had. Taguchi&#039;s storyboarding is something else. The voice actors are really killing it as well. Couldn&#039;t be more perfect casting for Yhwach.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the visuals, it&#039;s probably the best episode of anime Pierrot has ever produced. It&#039;s unbelievable how detailed all of that really was, despite being filled with complex visual effects and composition. The effects are easily the best this season. Then it changed it up with some CGI, that, while not drawn like how I&#039;d prefer it, it was still amazing. The focus on colours is insane.<br />
<br />
Also, the music. Sagisu is the GOAT. Enough said.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who felt like Aizen&#039;s scene resembled Evangelion in a way? "

"[quote=daft_mariner message=67967686]Am I the only one who felt like Aizen&#039;s scene resembled Evangelion in a way? [/quote]<br />
It did give the evanglion and some old anime vibes. I guess its because of the colors as well."
"Holy moly, that was some display of power from the old man. Too bad that he lost his head too easily and couldn&#039;t figure out the trap while revealing all his secrets. I&#039;m curious what the North Bankai had to offer though, lol. Hopefully, that&#039;ll make a comeback next week otherwise, Soul Society is in deep deep trouble... <br />
<br />
Man, Pierrot really stepped up the sakuga during some of the action scenes there! I knew they&#039;d rise to the occasion but I didn&#039;t think it&#039;d be this early and of this quality, this adaption really is a blessing. <br />
<br />
Good to see Aizen after a long while! I got NGE vibes from that scene lol, that must be nice cushion there xD. <br />
<br />
Ishida slowly learning about the truth behind the Quincy&#039;s eradication is interesting, they&#039;re definitely building up to something. Meanwhile, Ichigo is still afk, I wonder how long it&#039;ll take for him to get out of that jail. <br />
<br />
@Zettaiken Hey, that&#039;s a good spot! Really nice from the wonderful folks over at Pierrot to give him some well-deserved recognition. "

BANKAI ZANKA NO TACHI 
" screaming, crying, throwing up, pulling out my hair, bashing my head into the wall<br />
<br />
great episode..."
Already Anime Fight of the Year + Anime Episode of the Year (before a future BLEACH episode potentially steals it)

Yamamoto has always been kinda ignorant regarding that. Same with how he tried to counter Kyouka Suigetsu. While the result was what he has hoped for, the theory he made up was very wrong haha. The only reason Yamamoto was able to know it was the real Aizen was because he touched Kyouka Suigetsu. "
So long old man your flame died today
one of the best eps in anime
"absolutely brilliant<br />
"
Yama bankai&#039;s visuals were amazing! The pinnacle of Bleach here!
"Best anime episode of 2022<br />
BLEACH SEASON"
"The Animation was really amazing,Yamamoto his bankai has so much power that was so crazy with the skeletons.<br />
In the end it was not Yhwach. "
"I love that the new season started with BANG! What&#039;s, even better is that they ain&#039;t censor it at all. This has everything starting with blood, gore, and more. Seriously, I&#039;m bored lately watching the current anime season because most of them are targeted at kids... Bleach is the cherry on top. As for the episode - rest in peace Yamamoto, you were GOAT, gigachad, badass, etc. It&#039;s hard to find a word that can describe your awesomeness. I&#039;m happy that we finally have seen Sosuke Aizen. As the adage says, It&#039;s all part of the Aizen plan. I&#039;m looking forward to the next episode. Bleach is such a blast to watch."
"we got yhwach,zanka ho tachi bankai ,Sasuke aizen ,best fight....if this isn&#039;t a 5/5 ep...I don&#039;t know what else could be...<br />
even though yhwach won....Yamamoto was too op....they have to win by tricks..."
"I cannot believe this series keeps delivering like this. The fight, animation, and story just in this episode alone are mindblowingly good. I need to process all tht just happened. Wow, just... wow."
" Tomohisa Taguchi directing probably the most important anime of the new decade, this episode was done far beyond expectation. 10/10"
"Amazing episode, one of the best chapters in the whole arc, too bad the story starts to drag a bit now, only getting better in one battle in the end.<br />
<br />
My favourite moments now: [spoiler]we get Squad Zero with the best girl Senjumaru, then we get Kurotsuchi&#039;s fight that starts off alright at least, then we get Shunsui&#039;s bankai in a super dragged battle and the best moment Kisuke&#039;s bankai, after that it gets quite boring[/spoiler]"
wth ost and animtaion fight peerfffeeeecccct
"This episode went above and beyond with its dialogues and visuals... I couldn&#039;t have asked for more. Studio Pierrot did an excellent job and seeing the Aizen and Ywach conversation adds a cherry on top, which was an anime original content. This shows how much they are putting effort into this. Cant wait for the further episodes"
This is literally one of the undisputed best episodes in anime...
"Wtf was this fight definitely top 5 of all time in bleach anime. <br />
Yhwach fighting yamamoto was fake but he still held up to his bankai which had power to turn the whole soul society into ashes. This makes me wonder what is the power of real yhwach is. <br />
And ya he also stole yamamoto&#039;s bankai so he is probably even stronger now. <br />
<br />
But most surprising was that aizen showed up. I already knew this will happen at some point in the story but didn&#039;t expected him to show so early. Can&#039;t wait to see him in action. <br />
He is one of my fav bleach characters. <br />
5/5"
maddening and saddening to see Yamaji die like this :(
masterpiece cant say more!!!
Couldn&#039;t Yamamoto go out without losing his Bankai? I hope that he was smarter than that.
Best EP so far. They went crazy with the animation. I was able to feel the heat from the fire watching it. 10/10 EP.
"I don&#039;t think I can properly describe this episode in words. Multiple artstyles, all quite beautiful, were being used here thanks to a number of renowned animators involved here, including the likes of the legendary Q Kawa, well known for his work in Mushoku Tensei. Hell, even a great fan animator was also involved, which I thought was quite nice to know. Nearly the entire episode felt like a whole movie, if anything. Zanka no Tachi is now fully animated after all those years of waiting. The passionate animation staff sure didn&#039;t pull their punches here, and it wasn&#039;t quite perfection as it could&#039;ve been, it was quite a masterpiece presentation for me, not just on the animation side of things, but also in terms of the scene directing as well, especially with the brief flashes of the younger version of Yhwach and Yamamoto to convey the sense of deja vu. The CGI on the skeletons being summoned by Yamamoto wasn&#039;t the ideal aesthetic choice by any means, but it still does the job all the same in making them look creepy and unnerving as they should be. The storyboarding was also great with the twist at the end, predictable as it kinda was, and we also get some really nice anime-original context with Uryuu finding out more about the history of the feud between the Shinigami and the Quincies and the truth behind it. Seeing Aizen again was also really nice as well.<br />
<br />
All in all, an 10+/10 episode, like a painting literally brought to life and put onto the big screens."
"WHAT AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!!!<br />
<br />
Good job to everyone who worked on this episode, they deserve all the praise in the world. <br />
<br />
Congrats to all Bleach fans who were patiently waiting for a decade, you deserve this level of effort from the studio.<br />
<br />
Keep the hype!!! Let&#039;s go Aizen,Retsu,Squad Zero!!!!❤"
"Wooow what did i just watch!<br />
What kind of crazy quality is this!"
amazing episode very good director
"Amazing adaptation, although they skipped two moments I would&#039;ve loved to see. Remains to be known whether they&#039;ll be included later."
Easily one of the best Bleach episodes! Absolutely phenomenal.
This is probably the single best episode of any anime that I have seen this year.....just speechless man...Yama&#039;s Bankai and the return of the G.O.A.T himself Sosuke Aizen... 
the CGI corpses bruh
"Oh holy Bankai of Bankais, that was wild!!!!"
"I was hoping for a better animation for this episode. <br />
But whatever, this fight is still epic."
"Let&#039;s goo!!!! The second bankai!!! And it&#039;s the head captain&#039;s!!! The animation was awesome!!! Every swing of the sword was well done!! I loved this episode!!! We also get to see Aizen. Making an appearance in this episide was part of his plan!!! Anyways, things are not looking good for the head captain now, since he fought with a decoy and his bankai was also stolen. Let&#039;s see what happens next!!!!"
"[b][color=#FF19F0]what can i say, ive known this would be an insane episode for several years now. The wait was worth it [/color][/b]"
"[color=red][b]Surprisingly, worst episode so far.[/b][/color]<br />
<br />
[list]<br />
[*][b]Audio mixing was all over the place for this episode.[/b] Very bizarre choice with 1) either not having any OST at all for some moments or 2) having the OST be so quiet that you could barely hear it at all. Everyone&#039;s voices were super loud, but everything else was really quiet.<br />
[*][b]The animation wasn&#039;t the best, let&#039;s be real.[/b] Everyone wanted it to be, but it wasn&#039;t. The CGI was baffling (especially with the skeletons) and there were also a few animation frames that were reminiscent of the abominable Naruto VS Pain fight from way back when. Yamamoto jumping around like a monkey for no reason also felt a bit out of character.<br />
[*][b]The pacing and direction of the episode was really bad[/b], which doesn&#039;t surprise me all that much when you realize the episode was directed by [url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=229398]Ema Saitou[/url] of Boruto fame. They literally have no other credits except for a handful of Boruto episodes, most of which weren&#039;t even rated that high (below 4 stars). [b]They rushed through Yamamoto&#039;s Bankai abilities[/b] and didn&#039;t give any of them any room to breathe before he was moving on to the next one. A Bankai this hype should have been given more room to breathe; when he said &quot;Bankai! Zanka no Tachi&quot;, my reaction was literally &quot;WHAT?&quot; and not because I was surprised, but because it happened in such a weird, lame way without any kind of [i]oomph[/i] to it.<br />
[*]The brief flashes back to a younger Yamamoto were also done in a really bizarre way (direction-wise), except for when Yamamoto he used Zanka no Tachi: Kita. That time it actually looked really cool.<br />
[/list]<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;ll give this one a [color=#c69a0e][b]3/5 (rounded up from 2.75/5)[/b][/color], partly because my expectations were [i]suuuuuper[/i] high (especially with the animators asking us to &#039;keep an eye out&#039; for this episode on Twitter).<br />
<br />
And I don&#039;t wanna trash the animators btw, they&#039;re overworked enough as it is. Besides, the animation wasn&#039;t even my main gripe with the episode, it was everything else surrounding it. The audio mixing, the poor directing, etc. The animation could have worked just fine if all the other aspects held up their end, but they clearly didn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
[b]EDIT[/b]: I&#039;ve also realized this episode drops my overall rating of TYBW Season 1 [b]from 8.7 down to 7.8[/b] after reevaluating the current direction. It&#039;s a shame, but it is what it is. I hope they get their shit together for the rest of the cour."
"DAMN, EPIC FIGHT SCENE<br />
but it wasnt actually him :0<br />
rip yamamoto genryusai"
"I&#039;ve read Bleach so many years ago and the last couple of arcs were so tedious to read I don&#039;t remember anything, so basically watching it like an anime only. The fight was great. It was the most satisfying combat I&#039;ve seen in anime in ages. Shame it got belittled by the aftermath. Something was obviously not right with the main antagonist going down so easily but turning it around with a fakt was such cop out. To add insult to injury, Yamamoto acted like a rookie not measuring the opponent and acting out the dumbest action trope - turning back to the fallen enemy without checking him. It was kind of insulting to that fight and the viewer. How was that different from YGO and &quot;a-ha, you activated my trap card, you lose all your life points!&quot;.<br />
<br />
By the way, was Kanpachi defeated off screen or did I miss something?"
Best episode of the year.

Go watch the after credits scene of episode 5."
"Amazing plot twist!!!<br />
Chichiiiiii!!!! kekeke"
When he was melting the floor&hellip;that was so sick
"Cgi and skeleton sound fx weren&#039;t as bad as I expected, although they still could be much better, episode is fantastic overall"
BLEAHC IS SO FUCKING PEAK OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
"I was so into Old Man Yama&#039;s battle that I forgot I didn&#039;t understand Japanese.  Subs were totally unnecessary. <br />
So, Kenny just thought he killed the copycat Quincy.  Guess he could copy himself.<br />
The Seireitei is fucked.  They all can&#039;t live in Ichigo&#039;s closet.<br />
"
"[quote=FunnyS__ message=67967844]Haven&#039;t seen the ep but are there any bad scenes at all?[/quote]<br />
Plenty, if animation is your only concern. There were a few Naruto VS Pain esque frames (if you catch the reference), but I think most people will be more offended by the CGI. My personal gripes are with the sound mixing and directing. They barely used any OST in the entire episode, which is baffling considering Bleach has some of the most hype-inducing soundtracks in any anime out there, and they just fast-forwarded through all of Yamamoto&#039;s abilities without giving any of them any room to breathe. No reactions from any of the characters on the outside either, which made it seem like they had just randomly teleported to another dimension. This much destruction going on in the middle of Soul Society, you would think people on the outside would react to it a little bit, but we got nothing.<br />
<br />
That last paragraph may be a bit pedantic, especially since I think it is accurate to the manga, but I guess it just highlights that sometimes a 1:1 adaptation doesn&#039;t work. Certainly not with this kind of directing."
The best episode in 2022 so far and I don&#039;t think there are any challengers that can match bleach except for JoJo part 6
"when you think about it, this random quincy that we wont even remember his name, is actuallly one of the strongest enemies we ve seen so far, he defeated Kempachi an Yama had to use his ultimate attack to kill him, like WTF? <br />
<br />
i think the music is lacking in these fights NGL, the CGI looked fine from affar, the problem was the close up shots <br />
wheter you liked the fight or not, this is one of the highlights of the entire arc but i gotta say i was dissapointed that Yama never got to fight the real Ywacht"
Speachless ... i cant say anything !
"MY MAN IS THE FUCKING GOAT, THE FUCKING G.O.A.T<br />
<br />
god damn Yamamoto is so fucking cool"
"[quote=silversaint message=67968135][b]i think the music is lacking in these fights NGL[/b], the CGI looked fine from affar, the problem was the close up shots [/quote]<br />
Finally, someone agrees with me on this! I get the whole &quot;no music&quot; trope that Studio Pierrot tries to do sometimes (they did that in Naruto too) but I don&#039;t think it worked here. It works better for slower, less amped-up situations; Yamamoto&#039;s fires were symbolic of his rage and very much in line with the definition of amped-up. And I think that deserves some tunes lol. Almost makes me want to make an edit of this using some of the OG Bleach soundtracks."
this episode was pure fire (pun intended)
"The 2D animation was on-point as usual but goddamn that 3D animation during the skeleton scenes was fucking awful. It would&#039;ve looked decent 10 years ago but having that level of shitty CGI in 2022 is inexcusable imo. It made what was a cool-looking manga scene into something embarrassing to even look at in the anime. The fight was a 10/10 up till that point, then fell down like 5 points. What a shame.<br />
<br />
Also I loved how the roof scene with the tiles was basically a rip-off of Hiruzen vs Orochimaru from Naruto. Also hooray for Aizen&#039;s return."
"RIP 🙏 Yamamoto Genryusai Shigekuni<br />
Mind blowing Zanka No Tachi<br />
One of the strongest Soul reapers to ever exist 🥲 felt bad for him 😭 (op animation)"

It&#039;s just my opinion but I feel like the music&#039;s been lacking a majority of this season so far. Some tracks are decent but compared to what I could remember from watching the original Bleach, the music is far less impactful and fun to listen to here. Even feels a bit lacking in amount like in episodes like these, probably the biggest issue I had with this episode as a whole. Still thought this was a solid episode though."

Yup. I hate using this zoomer lingo, but I literally cringed when the skeletons came up on the screen. I started questioning what I was even watching, felt like I was being pranked by Pierrot."
What a fight. I remembered from the manga that Yamamoto lost so it didn&#039;t make sense at the beginning. Great to know more about his bankai...

I feel the same way. I actually had to bring down my overall rating of this season&#039;s OST after reevaluating it a little bit. I had rated it pretty high initially because the first episode kind of baited us with the iconic Number One theme they used for the introduction of Ichigo and co. and so I was under the impression that the rest of the season would be more of the same, but at this point, it doesn&#039;t look like it.<br />
<br />
The new soundtracks have been pretty weak and not really at all memorable, perhaps with the exception of the remix of one of the OGs that played when Kenpachi showed up in the previous episode. It was short-lived, but I liked it.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t mind if they just reused more of the old soundtracks. Is there some kind of licensing reason for why they are [i]not[/i] doing that? Or do they just want to be stubborn about it and make everything new even when it makes no sense to? OG Bleach had so many good soundtracks, it would be a real shame if we never heard Invasion, Treachery, or Quincy&#039;s Craft in TYBW."

"Such a relief it was to those beaten up ears of every kind back in Soul society when it was loudly announced Kurosaki Ichigo&#039;s heading there to free them up from the &quot;Quincy&quot; nightmare, only to things getting worse just a minute later. Ichigo&rsquo;s stuck in garganta and people are getting obliterated left and right, irrespective of their ranks.<br />
<br />
Started with As Nodt with that husky voice(!!) toying with Byakuya, instilling the very sense of fear in that strong persona that too with his very bankai of anything, then Renji followed the suit and same with Rukia. Though &ldquo;THE MAN&rdquo; Kenpachi did arrive at the scene, and hell he straight up challenged Yhwach lol. Best man for a reason. <br />
<br />
Got the flashbacks of Yamamoto and Sasakibe, they been through a lot and did they do a good job showing Yamamoto&rsquo;s wrath.. hell yeah. Damn his presence alone on the battlefield lifted up the motivations to a whole hundred.<br />
<br />
Epic faceoff coming, Yamamoto against Yhwach. And yet again the Mother of hype just not leaving us."
"These two episodes are going to be really big for Bleach fans and for the production as well. And yes, it is just pure carnage in this episode. It was a sad day for Byakuya fans. I felt bad watching him like that. And, it was time for Kenpachi to come out and be the absolute GOAT that he is along with grandpa Yamamoto.<br />
<br />
The backstory on Yamamoto and Sasakibe was very nice. And then, the rage scene was so fucking fire. That OST. The next episode of Bleach will probably be the best episode in the Bleach franchise. <br />
<br />
That post-credits scene was pure KINO. "
"Well, Ichigo himself is literally in this unknown trap being setup up, and regardless of all the techniques he is using, it ain&rsquo;t going to work, and he has a time limit to save others. Oh well, but heh, what in the world happened to that MF getting sliced in half all of a sudden? Renji and Byakuya&rsquo;s end are determining the nature of one of the Wandereich&#039;s techniques; they&rsquo;re sure being &quot;intellectual&quot; about this for the sake of safety, but that&rsquo;s some compensation once in a while that implies prior experiences. The long-haired masked guy&#039;s got an interesting weapon up his sleeve, and he has a serious but advantageous case of paranoia with a first thought in mind before he even admits it, lol. It&rsquo;s more of a mental memory of where he can dictate Byakuya&rsquo;s authorities, strength, and shit. Of course anyone would feel fear in this kind of fight, as the long-haired masked guy is already bringing up some terror. <br />
<br />
The moment Rukia turned into that disgusting looking monster freaks me out lol, Byakuya needed to build up his fear instincts, just like having some analogies of insects crawling in his body, having other experiences, etc. The amount of blood coming out of Byakuya&mdash;oof, Renji got his manup, and I really like the fight sequences here&mdash;well, there&rsquo;s no way for Renji to beat that long-haired, masked guy. Yamamoto in his younger self looks so different; he may be refusing others to learn from him, but gradually he&rsquo;s just merely accepting it. Well always, I&rsquo;ve been gassing Kenpachi since the Hueco Mundo because he always got that monster in him but nooo my man is NOW getting choked to death 😭😭😭😭 but Yamamoto after his past storytelling going back with that flame, things are heating up, especially in the next episode, which will definitely cover something between Yamamoto and Yhwac (Don&rsquo;t miss out the post-credit on this episode).<br />
"
"Damn, seeing Byakuya without his bankai and on the knees was painful. Reiji tried his hardest but seems like he didn&#039;t make much of a difference. One thing I&#039;m impressed with this season so far is the sheer emotional volume of the characters.<br />
<br />
It was great to see adult Yamamoto and some of his background story. A reminder that he is still a mighty badass in this timeline. "
"Zaraki got defeated was unpredictable!!!<br />
Yamamoto Genryuusai was once Eijisai and then turned his name into Genryuusai because of his subordinate... that&#039;s hella respect man!<br />
Yuhabahha is in real Trouble now! got get him Captain!<br />
meanwhile, Ichigo is still stuck at that area, when will he be out of there?!<br />
AND WHO DEFEATED THE J ONE?!?!?<br />

I am still a bit disappointed but now I&rsquo;m more realistic about what to expect. The likes of Ufotable and Mappa made expect a bit too much out of shows these days (their shows have their own flaws ofc), and Bleach first episode made me believe we were getting that kind of quality. It&rsquo;s all good tho, bleach is back and that&rsquo;s all that matters! :)"
"Sasakibe&#039;s flashback was pretty good. Young Yamamoto was a badass (well, he still is)<br />
I&#039;m just happy to see my boi Zaraki again.<br />

Edit: There is a important post-credits scene, so do not close the episode until the ED is completely finished.<br />

"For those that missed the news, the dub for this season started last Friday!<br />
<br />
This episode wasn&#039;t looking good for the Soul Society in the first half. It&#039;s a good thing Kenpachi and Yamamoto showed up in the second half to give them some hope (at least until the post credits scene, haha). Both sides took major losses, and it will likely continue being a struggle for the rest of the war.<br />
<br />
Ichigo&#039;s closest friends in the Soul Society didn&#039;t fair well, so hopefully that gives him the motivational boost to power through the jail that Quilge set up. <br />
<br />
The really interesting part of the episode was Yamamoto&#039;s flashback and confrontation with the Quincy, The Overkill. The Overkill used Sasakibe&#039;s Bankai, but it seems like it wasn&#039;t nearly as powerful as it should have been. That suggests that the Quincy aren&#039;t as efficient at using the Bankai and either can&#039;t use its full power or that they need to practice with it first before being fully capable of utilizing its full abilities, which makes sense.  <br />
<br />
This episode thankfully had much better pacing than the previous episodes. Next episode looks like the two bosses will be duking it out, so that should be fun. "
Happy to see Sasakibe finally got to use his own Bankai onscreen for the first time
Yamomota vs ywhach lets go finally we can see the old man going all out also kenpachi entry was op
That animation was so good 
shit is getting real 
"Kenpachi is a savage lmao<br />
<br />
But damn, even he got foookked "
"oh shit they added a bankai for Vice Commander eh thats a cool filler <br />
<br />
while the animation quality is decreasing the AD or animation directors drawings and corrections are still strong so i expect this will be the norm for none priority episodes like this <br />
<br />
some info about what animation directors aka AD for short does in the anime industry since its different than the western animation industry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation_director#Eastern_production_pipeline<br />
<br />
next episode should be a full sakuga episode i hope because its Captain Commander going fire "
Awesome episode and Yamamoto is on fire baby
"In this episode we see why Zaraki can be a MC, the enemy was giving a monologue and he just rip the throat of the guy. <br />
<br />
With that display of power for Cpt. Genryuusai, is hard not have the morale boosted to maximum."
Holy shit. The farewell to Sasakibe and the build-up to the fight of the year hit different. Yamamoto burned Driscoll down to the bones. Amazing episode.
Also the weirdest thing about this episode is that it implies the Zanpakuto Rebellion was canon as it shows Byakuya vs Koga in his flashback

I like the added bit of how Chojiro actually used his bankai. 
Ichigo needs another power up if he can&#039;t even destroy a lock skill from a Quincy. I wonder what kind of training he will be needing again. lol

"I was really worried to be greeted by another recap the moment I started the episode, and what I got in exchange was massive hype out of the crude and brutal slaughter of Byakuya, Renji and Rukia, and boi, As Nodt really giving me the creeps with his voice, that was so well done. The absolute state of despair and the dreadful feeling in the air really overwhelmed Ichigo, this was a perfect portrayal of the urgency of this quincy invasion, and it was done greatly.<br />
<br />
On the other half we got Yamamoto being an absolute hype machine, first introducing part of his backstory with sasakibe, and then, after the backstory ends, the man went full chad mode, fucking incinerated Sasakibe&#039;s killer, and threw his entire anger across the entire Soul Society, hyping up all the remaining Captains and other shinigamis that were losing their battles, boosting the morale of Soul Society. That was so damn hype and fire I couldn&#039;t even believe my eyes.<br />
<br />
The pacing this time around felt more adequate, it was slower than usual, but it did it&#039;s job perfectly, it portrayed the despair greatly and everything looks so damn clean, I&#039;m glad the recap was only a thing of last episode, now I understand why they decided to make episode 4 shorter because holy shit, all the absolute fire was saved for this episode.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, gotta love how Kenpachi slayed 3 Sternritters like it was nothing, but that&#039;s Kenpachi for you lmao.<br />
<br />

Kinpachi had me cracking up.  He had 3 dead bodies.  The other captains better get it together cuz they will not live it down.  Kinpachi doesn&#039;t let them finish their little spiels which I love about him.  You hear to fight or talk?  LOVE HIM!! My eldest brother&#039;s name was Kenny and he loved to fight. Maybe it&#039;s the name.  LOL <br />
<br />
The Quincy King stopped Kenny with his arm.  That&#039;s crazy strong."

"Best episode up until now by far. So much has happened and yet it flowed perfectly. Although I do feel sad about Byakuya, but I had read the manga so I knew what to expect, and damn was that &quot;fear&quot; scene just masterfully handled.

I feel like most of the extended fights will be coming later as opposed to the ones right now since they&rsquo;re barely fights. And with the speed of the adaptation it&rsquo;ll leave a lot more room for extensions and new stuff. <br />

Also TYBW is not seasonal so you probably shouldn&rsquo;t expect top tier animation in the less important stuff. Next week is definitely important though"

I loved the episode. The tense and desperate tones were done well the art and music was amazing. Animation was good and some scenes had splendid animation but I can see they&#039;re saving budget for the good parts and since this is a mostly passive episode with not much action but a lot of hype.
"This was my favorite episode after episode 1, we could feel the tension, like everyone said better pacing, good art direction as always but iam starting to get worried about the fights, 5 episodes and we havent really gotten sakuga scenes, i hope it will not be like black clover where sakuga is just reserved for the most hype fights and everything is just ok, because the show supposed to have 4 cours, FMAB was 64 episodes and was filled with sakuga."
the &quot;chichi&quot; Shigekuni seems angry!!! kekeke
Holy shit that was amazing. Every episode keeps getting better and better.
"Was disappointed that we got yet another rushed episode, especially since we were previously led to believe that some off-screen fights from the manga were going to be expanded upon in the anime, yet we still didn&#039;t get to see Kenpachi&#039;s full fights with those 3 Stern Ritters. Bet Kenpachi&#039;s fight with Yhwach will be completely off-screen too at this rate. Ffs. Yamamoto&#039;s scenes were cool I guess. "
"3.5/5<br />
<br />
I keep saying this every week but this might be the best episode so far. The animation has definitely improved especially in the fight sequences. Still not too sure on the abrupt direction choices but overall, a solid episode<br />
<br />
AS Nodt feels more menacing in the anime and as one of my favorite designs in the entire show, I can&#039;t help but get a little giddy. Byakuya was taken care of too easily and the infamous blood splattered Byakuya panel was not done justice. I&#039;m sorry but apart from that, I have no major qualms for the rest of the episode. Kenpachi was looking to go wild but it&#039;s Yhwach we&#039;re dealing with here, he made quick work of supposedly the wildest captain and is now face to face with my mans Genryushai, the highlight of the episode. The backstory hit harder with beautiful and haunting osts, which again I can&#039;t praise enough. The whole episode felt more urgent and now we&#039;ve perfectly set up for a round 2 with even more action to follow, can&#039;t wait!!!<br />
"
Absolutely amazing. There are no words to express how pleased i am with how this episode turned out. Just simply amazing!!!
The Byakuya vs &Auml;s Nodt is very epic. Damn byakuya getting hit by his own bankai was intense and horrifying and hard to watch.
"[quote=deg message=67918068][quote=Usopp8000 message=67917648]AND WHO DEFEATED THE J ONE?!?!?<br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
the manga never revealed who killed him but many fans are suspecting it was Grimmjow that killed him [/quote]<br />
I thought he was dead ??"
"Wow, I thought shit couldn&#039;t hype me up more than ep1 but oh man was I wrong. The way Yamamoto took off gave a chilly feeling down the spine despite it being so fire god damn. The Rukia fear moment broke my heart, you can&#039;t do that to my girl :(. Peak fiction yet again, studio Pierrot is just exponentially evolving from one episode to another!!!!"
Best episode so far imo. They captured the despair in the first half and Yama&#039;s anger in the second half perfectly.
"I dislike Disney and I dislike there politics.  More so they even bought up the bleach distribution rights in the west.  But so far I&#039;ve not seem them injecting any of their weird ass politics into the show, and on the flip side they might be a force for anime good and bring all of Bleach to a global audience.<br />
<br />
Ps, this eps rocked.  Roll on next week!"
It&#039;ll make sense for the enemy to hit their command center as well. Fear though is an interesting weapon that the quincies created. But thats what made As Nodt that terrifying of a foe. Even more so seeing Byakuya be cut down by his own bankai as well. Still the surprise attack sure cost the society dearly in lives. Kenpachi sure made things look easy by slaying three of the sternritter by himself. But he was the exception. Using the bankai of Yamamoto&#039;s oldest friend and advisor against him after so brutally killing him was such a grave insult to the LT. The insight into their past also did well to reinforce this point. That was one hell of a sendoff though but one that was well done as its fuel was the body of the one who was responsible for his untimely death. But the raise in morale that the head captain inspired via his entry on the field was nice. A pretty strong ep that featured not only some good action but some nice expansion on the head captain and the sternritter as well. 
"[b][color=#FF19F0]cant wait for the epic battle next episode, eeeek im fanboying &gt;-&lt;[/color][/b]<br />
"
"byakuya lost.. sad, kenpachi killed three but also lost.. sad<br />
but damn, the head captain is so flipping epic, i look forward to fight<br />
don&#039;t care about ichigo"
Wow that was insane.
Amazing episode! Kinda sad that kenny got off-screened like that but WOW YAMAMOTO! 
"Animation wasn&#039;t at its peak levels but this episode had a ton going on with the pacing being better, just an overall hypefest of an episode as a whole with a great cliffhanger too in this Invasion. Yamamoto&#039;s presence definitely had an intense aura to it, especially in his confrontation at the end. Wished for more animated action but the tension building was great as a whole here, expect the next couple episodes to pop off crazy."
"Art, lighting, compositing, direction, animation, voice acting and OST all came together beatifully this episode."
damn this episode was super hype im so excited to see what happens next~
"Everything is a jojo reference. ZA OVERKILL, ZA QUESTION, ZA ROAR, ZA YOURSELF.<br />
Aside from the joking and what more, this was quite a heavy episode. Ichigo&#039;s still stuck in there while the rest are getting murdered from left to right. Captain Byakuga losing quite hard against Nodt who has a pretty cool voice. Seems like he was no match for him and even struck fear in Byakuga. Kenpachi on the otherside defeated three members, but as we could see in the end, he lost easily against Yhwach. Fuck, I thought he had some chance, but guess not. Captain Yamamoto is the one that&#039;s the most furious out of everyone in Soul Society. Dude left Za Overkill no choice, but to burn to death. Also, it revealed Sasakibe&#039;s bankai which was so fucking cool, but he died so fast. The backstory was done perfectly and I really wished he&#039;d be here to fight alongside them and show how terrifying his bankai would be.<br />
Yamamoto vs Yhwachnext episode? Epic.<br />
<br />
Also the soundtrack was godly."
"This is truly the best episode in the history of cartoons, I&#039;m almost crying from the Yamamoto moment.<br />
"
"[quote=jahver message=67917971]Also the weirdest thing about this episode is that it implies the Zanpakuto Rebellion was canon as it shows Byakuya vs Koga in his flashback[/quote]Even in the previous anime they made the filler seem like it was canon. Either with flashbacks like this or having the annoying puppets appear, etc. I was hoping they wouldn&#039;t do that anymore, but I guess it&#039;s not really a big deal. So long as there are no long filler arcs like that"
"Bruh, I felt Yama&#039;s roar in my bones. What a scene!"
"This was perhaps the best episode of Bleach TYBW so far thanks to solid directing, even though it has not yet reached the actual big fights in the entire arc. Soul Society continues to get destroyed by the Sternritters&#039; onslaught, their screams and cries heard over the phone by a very distraught Ichigo whom is still imprisoned by Quilge&#039;s trap.<br />
The biggest highlight of the episode was definitely Yamamoto finally entering the fray, his wrath being felt by everyone within Seireitei and encouraging the remaining survivors and Captains to continue fighting. However, the Byakuya and As Nodt segments were amazing. Yoshisugu was really able to capture and portray the fear factor in As Nodt&#039;s voice, a chilling and haunting voice that instills a gripping sense of uncomfortableness and fear as he pressures and corners Byakuya...a very befitting seiyu for the character. That image within Byakuya&#039;s vision of Rukia, though....turning into a grotesque, rotting form...genuinely scared me. I admittedly got quite stressed out during the majority of that first part, as Byakuya was getting crushed by As Nodt, and seeing his own Bankai used against him pissed me off (in a good way). The aesthetics throughout the episode continue to impress me especially during key moments with its gloomy saturated atmosphere.<br />
The implementation of an anime original scene of a flashback of a young Yamamoto and Sasakibe was cleverly done, and fares off far, far better than a bunch of spoken dialogue. It was really able to depict how much Sasakibe meant to Yamamoto as not just a right-hand man, but an important comrade and friend. This really plays so well into the emotional momentum that is Yamamoto completely incinerating Driscoll in one shot after seeing and getting enraged by his very friend&#039;s Bankai being used against him, albeit a poorer fake version of it, if anything. This then of course leads into Yamamoto charging into the fray as mentioned before. The hype levels is off the charts here, especially with the post-credits scene with Yamamoto finally confronting Yhwach. Again, Shiro Sagasu killing it with the OST everytime, it&#039;s like Bleach means everything to this man.<br />
Next episode is definitely gonna be insane and where the animation will most likely really pop off."

Then you say &quot;But how so? That was a anime-only filler arc&quot;... either Kubo was part of the anime staff as a character designer for that arc, or he simply found the design good enough to reuse it in the manga. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a big deal, since the Zanpakuto Rebellion was well-received by fans and a lot of people love it despite being filler.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s see if there will be more flashback flashes from that arc again, if so, then maybe they are assuming the Zanpakuto Rebellion arc is part of the canon now?"

"[quote=AkaiAyame message=67918152]Finally the pacing has calmed down and I feel like I can truly enjoy the story, earlier episodes felt a bit erratic so I wasn&#039;t sure if it would feel so off but 5th episode has shown me the true potential of this arc.[/quote]<br />
It actually didn&#039;t calm down. They used 6 chapters like the episode before. Maybe the Manga pacing slowed down or you are just imagining things."
"I just want a definitive answer from you guys. Is the only draw of Bleach hype, stylish characters and fights? I&rsquo;m rereading the final arc now alongside the anime and the narrative is just as lacking as I remember it being years ago when I had to force myself to read the next chapter for years until its conclusion. I don&rsquo;t know. Been watching and reading this series for over a decade, trying to become a fan of it but it never clicked for me."
The episode is on fire 🔥 
"It&#039;s full tense with most of them getting rekt but we got Kenpachi&#039;s great moments for how OP he can be and Yamamoto&#039;s backstory with Chojiro during his trainings back then, damn he&#039;s also so OP of course."
goated as always ngl
Good episode. I am addicted to the Ed now.
"Best as ever, it bleach Btw"
And another banger episode
"Literally &quot;hype the series&quot;, with Kenpachi and Yama-jii showing off. Great episode."

Probably just isn&#039;t your thing tbh. The fights and cool moments are part of the appeal, but for most fans there&#039;s a lot of charm to the characters and setting. When you feel that way, it really pulls you into the world"
"Rukia and Kenpachi finally getting some screen time, just to get slaughtered<br />
<br />
Didn&#039;t expect Sasakibe to have had a bankai like that<br />
<br />
Hype for the next ep is real"

<br />
I mean what else do you need from a good Shonen series? I want likeable characters and cool fights. Bleach delivers on both. There are some flaws to it (mainly plot-related), but hey, I was instantly hooked. If it doesn&#039;t click it with you, it&#039;s totally okay. I&#039;ve tried to get into Fairy Tail, Gintama, One Piece and few other highly acclaimed shonen series and just couldn&#039;t force myself. Everyone has different tastes, it&#039;s like choosing clothes: some things just feel or look sorta weird on you even if you like the design, brand or the price."
Great episode!! 🔥🔥
"Yamamoto burned Driscoll to ashes. Absolute masterclass episode.<br />
YAMAGOATO FTW!"
"WHAT AN EPISODE.<br />
<br />
BYAKUYA&#039;S &quot;FEAR&quot; WAS BEAUTIFULLY ADAPTED, EVERYTHING IS JUST. EYEGASM.<br />

YAMAMOTO&#039;S ENTRANCE LITERALLY GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS. THE OST USAGE IN THIS EPISODE WAS PERFECT, THANK YOU PIERROT."

"Pure inhalation of the soul reapers in the Soul Society. It was nice to see Renji and Byakuya in this episode and the other captains. But, even they weren&#039;t able to stop the quinces. RIP... so many bankais. <br />
<br />
Also, things are looking really bad for the Ichigo squad as well. Things are getting way too tense for everyone."
"Yhwach&#039;s army is wreaking havoc in Soul society, the Sternritters. Be it the normal soldiers, seats, vice captains or heck even captains, they fucking toying with them, killing them like there&#039;s no tomorrow. We had the captains clashing against the Aizen&rsquo;s army back in the day but this.. this isn&rsquo;t even on the same scale anymore. Blood is raining everywhere.<br />
<br />
So hype it was watching captains using their Bankai, though only for sternritters stealing them a minute later. That&rsquo;s some OP as fuck ability they running with. Byakuya&rsquo;s Senbonzakura Kageyoshi still a beauty after all these years, but got stolen sadly.<br />
<br />
Ichigo&rsquo;s on his way to soul society but as if things will go smoothly even for once. Coming episodes will be all more bloody.<br />
<br />
They had a 2 minute recap but still adapted 5 chapters btw."
"Rose is such an underrated character so seeing him getting some spotlight is a blessing. <br />
<br />
Seeing Squad 6 with Byakuya and Renji fighting As was also pretty cool. Toshiro, Soifon, Kenpachi, and all the other captains etc are back too on the frontline! I guess they&#039;re focusing this season on featuring various captains and their squads taking on members of the Sternritter.<br />
<br />
Pretty cool episode and idc it&#039;s been 10 years, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi is still cool as fuck."
"holy shit that was an amazing ep<br />
3 min recap tho...<br />
and Ichigo going back to save soul society just like the good old days<br />
man its good to have bleach back"
"Goddamn, this was amazing.<br />
<br />
The pacing is everso intense, the situation looks as hopeless as it should, the fights are all set up for the next week, and one of my favorites moments of this invasion is just at the start of next chapter (quite awesome that they put all infodumps in place, and also revisited the shinigami body count they skipped last week).<br />
<br />
This adaptation is going places, can&#039;t wait to see my old man Genryuusai in action."
"Good, Yhwach is so cold, cool and badass"
"The scene after the Captains had their Bankai stolen was anxiety-inducing, seriously. They definitely nailed the desperation feeling. As Nodt most specifically is terryifing, Jesus<br />
OST is out of this world, and Senbonzakura Kageyoshi looks more beautiful than ever after all this years. In fact, it was already super cool even in the first anime.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I have to agree that the recap was too long. Hope it doesn&#039;t happen often.<br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/2BXLlzN.jpg[/img]"
"Animation was alright, I feel like they&#039;re saving all the budget for Yamamoto&#039;s fight. They added a few new scenes to the main fights although I wish they added more to Rose, Ukitake and Shuhei&#039;s fights but I guess they&#039;ve got a limited amount of content they can cover per episode. Not as many scenes were cut this time though so that&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Also we finally know who Ukitake was fighting"
"Great episode! Yhwach is brutal!<br />
Bye bye bankai(s)!"
"Only in the 4th episode and this had a long ass 3 minute recap to start the episode, and even with that, still felt pretty rushed overall. The pacing of this anime be bizarre af so far."
Here&rsquo;s to all the people that said BLEACH should&rsquo;ve ended after the Aizen fight
"Three minutes of recap, this is the Bleach I remember and love all right, haha.<br />
<br />
Not sure why that whole recap was needed when it could have been used to better pace the fights in this episode, as everything is still faster paced than it needed to be. That being said, perhaps it only feels so fast since I recently re-watched the original Bleach. <br />
<br />
The more we see of the Quincy, the more terrifying they become. This invasion is quickly looking like it will be a one sided battle unless something is done fast. The captains can&#039;t use bankai, and Ichigo is stuck in Quilge&#039;s technique. The soul society has gained more info about the Quincies, but it still may not be enough to gain an advantage. The Quincies are brutal. <br />
<br />
And yeah, like Ichigo said, the Quincies steal the bankais since they fear their power, so the goal to win will be to figure out how to neutralize that advantage.<br />
<br />
All in all, a nice action packed episode introducing some new cool characters. "
"Renji: hey, they steal bankai<br />
Byakuya: don&#039;t care, ban-  <br />
...<br />
oh shit."
"Decent episode, but the recap at the start was kind of a turnoff. Those few minutes that went into that, could have helped with the pacing and flow of the episode even more since they still adapted a bunch of chapters. Again, I prefer Bleach not going at a snail&#039;s pace like the original through, but I still feel like improvements can be done here to make it even better. Rest of the episode was decent, lots of re-introductions to familiar faces in Soul Society as they deal with the Stern Ritter and the episode building an atmosphere of hopelessness and desperation around Soul Society and the Soul Reapers there as their bankai can be stolen but Ichigo&#039;s, and he&#039;s having his own problems at the end there with being able to get to the area to help them with Quilge stopping him last minute. I liked the uncensored nature here again, makes the brutality of the Invasion feel even more raw and chaotic that way.<br />
<br />
Animation was alright, nothing special visually about the episode and lots of closeups and some still frames being present but in episodes like these, the insane animation don&#039;t really matter too much if it can be used in bigger fights down the line for the minimum. As long as it still looks fine and consistent enough to do the job, which it did here. Feels good seeing Senbonzakura Kageyoshi again after all these years too and have it look pretty sick in this adaptation (highlight visually for this episode), nostalgia definitely hit then alongside seeing some other characters in action too."
Best part till now is how they have eradicated all the possible conveniences from the Soul Society side. This makes things slightly unpredictable and interesting.
Breath taking marvelous astonishing piece of animated EPICNESS!!!
"im worried about the production, there is 3 minutes of recap already and there are some significant animation quality drops through out the episode but still good enough and i hope they can hold the quality together until the end <br />
<br />
but with how talented the core staff of this anime adaptation is it will have sakuga on important scenes for sure they just do not have enough production time it seems to make it all consistent <br />
<br />
so there it is Quincies can steal Bankai <br />
<br />
anyway Bambietta is sexy again <br />

"I dont even know where to start OMGGG 10/10 episode for sure, im so hyped for another episode of this masterpiece. "
"Loving the series so far. I know there isn&#039;t any Sakuga in this episode, this is just buildup to upcoming menace in future episode. &Auml;s Nodt had much screentime, byt didn&#039;t uttered a single word and just smiled when he stole Byakuya&#039;s Bankai. THAT WAS CREEPY AF. Got chills just seeing &Auml;s Nodt without any dialogue.Bambi-chan had only 2 lines in this episode. Laughed at Quilge&#039;s reaction when he sealed Ichigo in his jail, he just reminded me of Stroheim from JoJo part 2. Both are Nazis ,one is actual Nazi and other is a ghost Nazi."
"Hearing Soundscape to Ardor after all these years was awesome. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how the rest of the initial invasion is adapted, this part was pure chaos in the manga."
"The animation took a heavy downgrade this episode, I&#039;m not even hating here. It reverted back to the classic Bleach quality + 3 minutes of recap for no reason lol. We&#039;re 4 episodes out of 50+ here, can&#039;t help but to overreact.<br />
<br />
Then it&#039;s good again when Ichigo showed up. And damn, the OST is really good."
"This is how you return after 10 years! Perfect in every way. Pacing is so unbelievable, I am exhausted while watching ep 4."
"wow, this episode was bad for me..."
"Now of the captains, just Zaraki, we didn&#039;t seen yet.<br />
<br />
That ending was very exciting. "
episode after episode shit gets better and better its so good
"W ep, animation still holds up expectations, next eps are going to be crazy"
"a chaotic and engaging episode, the 3 minute summary gave me a sense of nostalgia, love it.<br />
Btw I wanted to see Soi Fon&#039;s Bankai in action but well I hope to see it later."
idk what people are talking about animation this episode was way better than last episode&#039;s looping animation of exposition.
"The situation is looking hopeless at the moment for the Soul Reapers. Four captains just lost their Bankai, and now Ichigo is unable to help them out since he&#039;s trapped. This episode did a good job of really showing the desperation and hopelessness of this conflict so far. "
"Random recap was very odd and off putting, but in a way it kinda made the rest of the episode&#039;s pacing to elevate in urgency, but at the cost of a very inconsistent pace. <br />
<br />
Really hoping this doesn&#039;t happen again."
"Im so happy that bleach is back and bring us this 4 officers komamura, hitsugaya, soi fon and kuchiki. <br />
Good that kuchiki has stopped renji to use his bankai, i want to know wher rukia is.<br />
Looks bad for Ichigo he got prisoned in the way to the Soul society."
"too many still images and speed lines, 5 minute recaps, 10/5"
"This episode was tense as hell, the imagery was out of this world. Bleach looks amazing in general."
The animation got better than last episode those who say otherwise are probably hatters
Good ep!! Ppl complaining about the recap yh it wasn&rsquo;t needed but that didn&rsquo;t make the ep bad! Plus ppl criticising the animation too.
"Another great episode, I wonder if next episode we will see the &quot;&quot;Save the Soul Society, Ichigo Kurosaki&quot;&quot; panel!!!"
another giga fire episode
"Would have liked if the episode didn&#039;t start with a 3 minute recap, but I guess that&#039;s just to be expected for such shows. <br />
Bunch of captains got their Bankai stolen and for some reason Ichigo is immune to it. Will be interesting to see how he can escape out of this."
"The Big reveal!!! Quincies don&#039;t seal the bankai, they steal it!!! It was great to see all the captains in action but their bankai&#039;s were stolen. Here&#039;s the catch tho, Ichigo&#039;s bankai can&#039;t be stolen!!! But welp he&#039;s trapped now. In some sort of cage. Things are not looking good. <br />
Anyways I can&#039;t wait to see next week&#039;s episode!!!!"
"I never imagined a day would come where I can see so much action from captain-level characters in one episode! My hairs stood on edge the entire episode and I literally shivered twice during the brief skirmishes of Captain 6, 8 &amp; 10. I also had a hunch Fear would affect Renji since he&#039;s a lieutenant. I guess he wasn&#039;t affected since he&#039;s now (RIP Sasakibe, I have a feeling Sasakibe was the strongest) the 3rd or 4th strongest lieutenant!<br />
This ending sure imparts an overwhelming sense of despair..... let&#039;s hold onto our breaths everyone!"
"Who&#039;s idea was it to have a 2+ minute recap of the past 3 episodes?<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this episode a bit with how impressive the Quincy Blut ability is in fending off against Shikai and other additional scenes. Let&#039;s see if Can Du&#039;s ability will be explored more since it seems like something very redundant with the Blut ability.<br />
<br />
But it seems like the anime dug its grave with a few claims like &quot;We can&#039;t beat them without Bankai&quot; and I talk about some characters coming up with that statement.<br />
<br />
I really hate the Bankai Stealing Medallion as in story it will carry no importance as we will soon see.<br />
<br />
Hope the fight against NaNaNa gets shown."
"great action, cant wait for more"
"OK... Episode 1 and 2 are a 10/10, but episode 3 and 4 are a 5/10. The first two were better than the manga, they were an spectacle, but the latter two were much worse than the manga and just felt off. Everything feels truncated, the animation is mediocre for the most part (not talking about the art and effects, they did a good job with art consistency and such), the direction is extremely questionable... Well, the first half of the last arc is, in my opinion, the best part of the story - and this is my favorite shonen - and they are doing a bad job adapting it for the last 2 episodes... I REALLY hope they do better in the next three weeks, if they don&#039;t, I will, unfortunately, drop this. I waited 10 years and never once thought I would be disappointed with Bleach&#039;s return..."
"What so they can even steal bankai?! The commanders battle was pretty but they got quickly stuck, even Ichigo didn&#039;t manage to escape from them and got jailed by the opponent even though they apparently can&#039;t still his bankai... Urahara didn&#039;t manage to take him down which is surprising actually"
"Nooooo, it ended so quickly... :( I wish anime episodes were also ~40 minutes each like most Western TV.<br />
<br />
Somehow I expected more things to happen in this week&#039;s episode, but I&#039;m still happy with what we got. Easy 4/5, excited for the next two episodes!"
"Senbonzakura Kageyoshi, RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!<br />
Still so fucking cool to see. Welp, they&#039;re getting overwhelmed even with their bankais.<br />
Quincies OP"
That was unbelievably epic episode!!
"It brings back the vibes from Naruto when Pain invade Konoha, i dont read the manga but next episode should be lit cant wait !"
Damm 1k dead in 7 minutes thats just crazy. The ever advancing blackness of death huh thats As Nodt. The aura that she gives is terrifying. Even with the captains and LT&#039;s here the odds are still dire. Turning your enemies greatest strength against them is the basics of basics in military strat. The thing is while the usage if Bankai at this stage was brash without using it the casualty levels among their squads would have increased tenfold. Man thats some dead serious determination that Quilge had though despite suffering injuries that would have killed a normal person. Overall a strong ep that featured not only a lot of shock value in seeing the assault on the society and the sternritter&#039;s trump card but also the desperate fight put up by the captains against opponents that were equal to them in terms of power. One thing that really impressed me this ep was the OST that really complemented the scenes excellently. 
every episode feels like the best episode so far; this one takes the cake now.
As Nodt is a cool creepy character.
Seeing the squad captains struggle against the quincies just show how strong they are. We still haven&#039;t seen what they have up their sleeve. The soul society is in the brink of extinction if they don&#039;t figure out the plan soon.
Why do they always have the antagonists looking like mentally deranged cross dressing clowns in Bleach? 
Senbonzakura kageyoshi giving me the chills!! Shame it lasted seconds.
damn... the Soul Society is getting slaughtered. It may actually fall now that Ichigo&#039;s trapped mid-flight :/
Oh boy!!!! I can&rsquo;t wait 6 more days for the next episode.
"Episode was not great. Animation is lacking and lots of still frames of the characters. The 3 minute recap in the beginning of the episode was completely unnecessary. <br />
<br />
I love Bleach and I am super excited to see some of the fights; but, I&#039;m not bias. I will admit when a product I was hyped for doesn&#039;t meet the hype. This adaptation is not meeting the hype -- for me, at least. I expected better animation tbh. Clearly I expected way too much. It&#039;s cuz there was so much chatter around the adaptation. "
"Upon closer inspection, only the recap was really odd. Having watched DBZimran review of the episode made my concerns dissipate and made me realize that the fight scenes in this part of the manga were actually extended. I imagine a 1-1 adaptation would have ended up far more rushed in certain areas while it feels like a slog in other if they included everything including the comedy that would honestly disrupt the pacing. So for now I&#039;m still happy with how the episoded ended up being.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll still point out that the recap was unnecessary."
God damn this episode was sooo GOOD! The quinces might be able to steal BANKAIS but they can&rsquo;t steal shit from Kenpachi. The Animation and the Art Style is really great tho I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a big fan of the RECAP. Honestly can&rsquo;t wait to see the rest animated aaaah
"they&#039;re doing such a great job adapting this,cant wait to get more"
Holy moly I think this was the second best ep of this season. Everything felt like it was balls to the walls. I got chills hearing Senbonsakura again. These quinces are so OP.  10/10
"[quote=MangagnaM message=67863906]Only in the 4th episode and this had a long ass 3 minute recap to start the episode, and even with that, still felt pretty rushed overall. The pacing of this anime be bizarre af so far.[/quote]<br />
Agree. I do not see why we would need a recap of the last three episodes."
"Dang and here I thought we wouldn&#039;t get any recaps anymore. I feel bad for all the fodder side characters, this is just straight up massacre. The situation is grave for all the captains who got their bankai stolen and I&#039;m scared for what&#039;s coming to them. I&#039;d be shitting my pants if I was the one who&#039;d face As Nodt, the guy is creepy and totally deserves his title Fear. I&#039;m gonna end up liking how they end every episode with a cliffhanger at this rate lmao. Pierrot is doing good at building up the anticipation we fans have every week. "
"idk what u think, I believe that every episode till now is so fcking GOAT... Byakuya gave me some amazing nostalgia. Everyone was perfect."
fools be trippin over bankai but they can&#039;t touch nr 15
"I still roll my eyes at the fact that Byakuya and some of the other Captains immediately thought to use Bankai when Shikai proved ineffective but didn&#039;t try to use powerful Kido instead. It&#039;s especially annoying in the case of Byakuya since he&#039;s really good at Kido. Also the fact that they knew Bankai could be &quot;sealed&quot; yet used them anyways lol.<br />
<br />
Episode was alright although the monologuing from certain characters kinda hurt the episode imo. It&#039;s something that happened a lot in the  original Bleach anime but I guess I&#039;d forgotten how annoying it is until seeing it again in this episode."
God I loved this so much especially the old OST...
Why does Quilge look like Till Lindemann after he absorbed Ayon lolll
That episode was crazy. They&#039;ve kept the quality up for 4 episodes so far so I have high hopes for the rest of the cour.
"If at this point in the ending, when next eps comes around, I dont get some white mask hollowfication, deep inner story, that starts with a single rain drop, I&#039;m gonna be pissed.  Shit is hitting the fan, and more shit keeps get throwing at it, and we demand an awakening! "
BleaChads... I kneel. Truly kino of them all.
boy they do not hold back with the blood. I think I saw at least 4 people bifurcated
"Crazy!! Cant wait for next ep<br />
"
Que massacre. A situa&ccedil;&atilde;o s&oacute; piora.
Broooooooooooooo
annoying cliff hangar though

Damn the intensity is real that Quincy dude with the spikes looked menacing ngl it was also cool to see Rengi and Byakuya and the others
"Bambietta showing what she came for, so incredible &lt;3<br />
<br />
Episode got very focused on the beginning of fights, but the real deal is about to start. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s keep going, Ichigo..."
"Would it really be Bleach without a useless two minute recap at the start of the episode?<br />
<br />
I really can&#039;t justify that this early on in the show. It seems like they&#039;ll do it every three episodes, which is better than every week, but ideally it&#039;d be never!<br />
As others have said, that time could be used much better to pace some of the action a bit better.<br />
<br />
Other than that, a good episode though. Perhaps not up to scratch with the quality of the first three, but I understand wanting to have a strong start above all else. Either way, the good news is that it&#039;ll be straight action from here on out for a few weeks now."
That was a one sided rout
top tier episode once again
"If i could go into the future and watch the rest of the TYBW arc, I definitely would. This arc is everything. The pacing is much better than the original Bleach. Overall amazing anime with plenty of violence to go along with it. 10/10 anime this season and I&#039;ve never given a ten to any anime before."
Cute enemies appear! AYAYA
"O MELHOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
"
kubo is such a goat bruh
bro it was SO GOOD.
"A very intense episode, looks like the Soul Reapers are going up against a strong opponent. I was really entertained by this episode, how they introduced the Quincy from the story and they also did a great job of portraying the power of the Quincy. I&#039;m really looking forward to the next episode because I want to see how did the SoulReapers get out of this really bad situation<br />
<br />
Really Good 5/5"
"i had the anime at 10/10, every episode has some kind of action, love it BUT<br />
when they put a recap on episode 4 and it triggers me, unable to enjoy the rest of the episode then yeah, -1, i am tired of this ****"
"seeing this final season is really making me wonder if I ever would of fallen out of watching bleach if it was actually paced properly, i feel like if this were the old serties wed of spten like 85% of the episodes runtime exclusively on renji and Byakuya fight."
a lot of fight sceene  i love it so much
"love it and Exciting, great, beautiful and attractive"
"Another excellent ep, 4 ep 10/10 so far. This ep was so tense man, finally we got to see Byakuya, Hitsugaya and Renji. Love it. Haters are going to complain about the 3 minute recap but they&#039;re just that haters, this ep doesn&#039;t fall a single second. "
"Intense episode. What will happen now to the captains and Ichigo-kun!<br />
<br />
Looking forward next week!"
"Great to see the Captains back in action, even if it is a little short-lived. Great action and violence in this episode, bravo to Studio Pierrot"
"Oh shit, the return of Ayon! I haven&#039;t seen that monster in a long time.<br />
<br />
Ichigo vs Quilge is a battle I&#039;ve been eager to see but seriously, Quilge is no pushover. On the other hand, at least the other captains are being prepared this time instead of getting a nasty surprise like Yamamoto himself did.<br />
<br />
This is still such a thrilling arc. The battle scenes are seriously insane. "
"With German vocabulary still going strong and so the megane Quincy, watching Ichigo attacking him with that og soundtrack in the background brought back that familiar feel, though dude powered up like hell until Ayon beat the shit out him, though that too wasn&#039;t enough to conclude his part in the story, he again powered up lol. Pierrot keeping up the good work.<br />
<br />
Mayuri digging up the long dead past between Yamamoto and Yhwach back into life sure made the mood even more tense, though that&rsquo;s kinda making it even more obvious about the inevitable epicness awaiting us ahead.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, Pain did the thing to Konoha and now Yhwach&#039;s about to do the same to soul society. Hype isn&#039;t leaving us anytime soon and thus the invasion of soul society is on its way."
"well, I&#039;m not going to write everything all over again since the original thread got deleted but the episode was great. Ichigo is hanging somehow but the situation is not looking very good for any of them."
"Oh boy, I still remember Ayon vs Yamamoto . Not saying it&#039;s great too see him back, but he does have some power. Ichigo vs Quilqe was incredible though with the soundtrack which have been so incredible so far. I&#039;m really digging it. Yhwach&#039;s goals are really just peaceful. Atleast in his eyes xD. "
Yhwach is here and he is just destroying soul society! More Quincies are introduced to us!
"Finally, Yhwach will go after Yamamoto in Soul Society!! Things will get even better now."
"And the Quincy invasion finally begins. Poor Izuru, not even getting a chance to fight before getting a hole blasted into him. But at least he didn&#039;t get his entire head blown off like that other soul reaper.<br />
<br />
This invasion just started and it&#039;s already brutal.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ichigo&#039;s battle in Hueco Mundo is a sight to behold. His Quincy opponent Quilge has the most overpowered abilities but he is still holding his own. <br />
<br />
There is so much packed into this episode, with Uryu, Ichigo, the Quincy history, and the Soul Society being invaded, it&#039;s hard to know what to be most excited about. What a great episode! The pacing still seems a little fast, but not yet enough to be a detriment."
"Animation looks gorgeous yet again and the ost&#039;s are on point, BLEACH SEASON"
"Man, I can&#039;t help but laugh when I see Yhwach on screen. Hopefully Kubo changes things following the first invasion otherwise he&#039;ll remain comedic relief in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Pierrot is doing better than expected in terms of production. TBD if writing is improved."
"They packed alot.<br />
Ishida + Ryuuken new stuff.<br />
Opie vs Ichigo + Tres Bestia + Ayon.<br />
Vollstanding.<br />
Principle of the Defeat, Breakthrough even and Never meant to belong remixes/other versions.<br />
Kira moment.<br />
Hidetomo/ or however he was called explaining to Shino and Ryuunosuke, I thought they won&#039;t go there + flashbacks to Orihime&#039;s Brother, Ishida vs Ichigo etc.<br />
Beginning of First Invasion.<br />
March off of the Stern Ritters.<br />
<br />
As I watched it raw I don&#039;t know what Uryuu and Ryuuken spoke about but so far I&#039;ve just noticed the words of VandenReich and Mother which seems they are planning to foreshadow the stuff which were never foreshadowed/teased/hinted in the manga, those who knows, knows what I mean there.<br />
<br />
Oh boy...<br />
Next week is gonna be fire, till the end of the cour."

Ichigo&#039;s battle in Hueco Mundo is breathtaking. Quilge, his Quincy opponent, has the most strong attributes, but he is still carrying his own.<br />

"Badass episode as usual.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t wait to see that one big fight [spoiler]with Yhwatch vs Genryuusai in this invasion.[/spoiler]"
"Wasn&#039;t too invested in the Ichigo-Quilge confrontation and fight here, but a lot happened in this episode to keep me engaged somewhat in this episode, even learning a bit more about the Quincy history and getting a refresher there after a long time, the revenge gauntlet they&#039;re throwing down after centuries in their own invasion of Soul Society and having the first impressions of it being unforgiving to watch at the end. Still not sure how the writing is going to turn out in this anime in the long run (been a long time since I read the manga), but the start&#039;s continuing to deliver somewhat in the hype, even if I don&#039;t think it&#039;s perfection or peak levels whatsoever. Pacing is still pretty solid and more watchable than a majority of the original Bleach, but can feel maybe a tad breakneck at times considering how much happened here to understand and let it sink through. Pierrot&#039;s production quality wasn&#039;t outstanding for the Ichigo-Quilge fight but it wasn&#039;t a big stakes fight so the animation did more than enough of a job to be solid and not just look off. Consistency in that department is there 3 episodes in, so that&#039;s a good sign for the time being. Hopefully this level of consistency can be met at least with this Invasion for the time being before thinking about how it would be for the whole show.<br />
<br />
Not the most hyped I&#039;ve been for a war arc though in recent times, that would be Coalition for Kingdom last year - which was incredible from start to finish. This one should be exciting though to start off given the way the Quincies and their thirst for revenge have been built up here so far."
"I just can&#039;t believe how perfect the adaptation is! And they&#039;re also adding new scenes to fill in gaps left by the manga.<br />
The animation is also gorgeous. Hats off to the studio."
"Yhwach has invaded Soul Society, we&#039;re about to witness something good in the coming episodes"
Things are looking great ... So far
"The Animation is crisp! <br />
Cannot wait to see next episode cause next episode will have someone vs someone fight."
Episode was straight. I liked the new added in scenes. Pacing was ok. I heard the old staff worked on this episode. Next episode should be great considering the invasion has started.
saw bazz B so shit is peak
what chapters did this episode cover?
"Content wise, still great and I like what they&#039;re doing with the pacing. 6 chapters adapted and they remove unneeded scenes/add important ones. Action direction was unfortunately mid. Lots of course correction. I can see the rumors for this episode having issues is true but the good outweighs the bad."
"I loved that they gave Uryu and his father Ryuken more scenes at last. Ryuken is perhaps one fot he most underutilized characters in all of the series. <br />
The rest of the fight between Ichigo and Quilge is perfect and its pacing didn&#039;t feel rushed. <br />
Its a pity however that they cut the scene where the Tres Bestias meet Orihime again and Sung Sun uses her Muda ability to hide everyone&#039;s reiatsu from Quilge but I suppose it could happen next episode while the invasion begins."

great episode and action
"Prepare for absolute peak, the Wandenreich&#039;s invasion of the Soul Society has begun.<br />
<br />
Also, I love how Quilge&#039;s initial Vollstandig looks imposingly angelic and majestic, because in his own words, the Quincy are &quot;holy executioners&quot; of the &quot;atrocious&quot; Shinigami and Hollows. But once he absorbs Ayon, its form becomes beastial and grotesque-looking. It&#039;s sublime narrative during the fight on the Wandereich&#039;s mindset: They see themselves as most noble yet are the most depraved in warfare.<br />

"Good episode, lots of set up for Uryu which will hopefully payoff later on. Opie fight was tame but there&rsquo;s still some left so it&rsquo;ll probably ramp up next episode.

Being able to see Ishida&#039;s development here is so good
"Finally the Quincy invasion has begun. Things are really  about to ramp up immensely, and I love how brutal and violent the action has been. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing more brutality in the coming episodes."
The uryuu ishida scene is very well added as he discovers that there are quinciers out there. He thought he is the last quincy.

"Episode little movement but still maintaining the quality, next episode things will get complicated... can&#039;t wait:)"
"Overall decent episode, but the fight choreography and character animation left a bit to be desired, specially given that this was one of the most hyped up early fights.<br />
You can definitely tell this episode had the production issues mentioned by leaks.<br />
I hope it&#039;s a one-off scenario with this episode and part 2 of the Ichigo vs Quilge fight next episode can compensate for this one.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, at least the effects animation, CG effects, compositing, SFX and OSTs were all pretty great, so they sorta made up for it and made the episode enjoyable nontheless.<br />
<br />
Overall good episode, but not amazing like the others."
"Loved the episode but personally I&#039;m not too much of a fan of how much content they&#039;re cutting out and yes I am aware of the episode limit and that things aren&#039;t that important but it just feels like they&#039;re butchering a bit even if I&#039;m still enjoying. One complain I have tho..was It really neccesary to change the part where Orihime,Chad &amp; the girls manage to hide from the enemy? xD instead they just skipped to the part where they showed the damage which was good but it kinda robbed a bit of characterization,almost making it seem like the gang sat there and did nothing even if they did have a possibility to hide themselves. Otherwise no complains. "
This episode feels so short
Interesting teasing about Ishida and the Quincy as a whole especially the soul balance explanations but now it&#039;s extremely worrying even though we got some great Ichigo action it looks like the raid truly started now

Almost 6 chapters in this episode, but as you said those cut parts were not that important"
"Wasn&#039;t a SS-tier episode by any means, but man there was A LOT to take in, especially with the anime original context involving Ishida. I honestly didn&#039;t feel like Ichigo vs Quilge was a particularly MAJOR fight, even though it was generally important, so I can understand the lack of focus on that part of the story in particular, considering everything else occuring during this episode. I still really prefer this swift pacing compared to the original anime and it helps that the scene direction of this episode was able to weave all the separate events happening simultaneously in different places together, hell it even helped make the episode more tense by the time Yhwach and the Sternritter pulled up on Seireitei and starting their killing spree. This episode didn&#039;t need to be very action-oriented considering the amount of dialogue and exposition that was there. Hell, FMA:B and HxH 2011 have done episodes similar to this many times before during their own run from what I can remember.<br />
<br />
Being refreshed on and learning even more about the history of the Quincies is also getting me more invested in this arc as well as more of an understanding of how and why everything in Bleach happened the way it did. Back to the Ichigo vs Quilge fight, while not flashy as many people probably wanted it to be, the art and animation did just enough at worse and I feel like the overall quality of the episodes will be able to hold up at this point at least for this first cour. Can&#039;t wait for things to really get started, and I know it&#039;s gonna be quite an emotional rollercoaster."
"*ichigo* <br />
Aww sh*t here we go again "
"why does everything look so good<br />
"
"wow, the animation was better than i thought"
"How crazy is that.So the quicys are the real enmey here and ishida wants to know more. <br />
Im so hyped these enemys are on completely another level.<br />
Ichigo in his bankai mode lets go."
"3/5<br />
<br />
Another fairly decent episode. A lot of scenes were added to give Ishida&#039;s character some urgency which was a great choice.<br />
<br />
Animation was again, for me still not hitting the mark and i have some qualms with the still image fights but I&#039;ll let it slide as its not that important. Hopefully we get some full on sakuga for the really hype match ups. The music was pretty average but bounced back during that last few minutes of the episode which was very thrilling. They are NOT letting up on gore which has me very excited.<br />
<br />
The quincies have invaded. Now, let the chaos ensue "
Bleach is always peak.
ewgefgsfafasfgfasdad
wwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww
Couldn&#039;t be better.
"Yes, this episode is again really good can&#039;t wait for the next one where the invasion will really unfold really great OST&#039;s and Animation yet again "
"Why does this episode feel so fast. I was very entertained by the story and animation of this episode. I really can&#039;t wait for the next episode.<br />
<br />
Always 1.000.000/5"
Finally it begins!
"And YET ANOTHER banger episode, holy."
Bro it&rsquo;s on sight the Quincy&rsquo;s are killing the soul reaper&rsquo;s so quickly that they don&rsquo;t even have time to summon there Zampacto&rsquo;s abilities and they killed Kira that was really messed up man he was one my favorites I remember his zampacto was sick
Meisterwerk weil halt bleach und shunsui 
i loved it..it was nice 
"I forgot this final arc pretty much entirely but the end it seems, but the drastic increase in violence in addition to how quickly its dished out has legitimately done wonders to the stakes of this series cause it really feels dire."
bazz-b&#039;s entrance is epic
THIS SHOW IS SO DAMN HYPE I CAN&#039;T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE~!!
THIS SHOW IS SO DAMN HYPE I CAN&#039;T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE~!!
"It was such a great episode! Truly a masterpiece. From the fights and animation to the soundtracks and the way there were used! A true work of art! I really loved the new versions of old songs. And finally I start to like more both the opening and the ending.<br />
<br />
As for the plot, I really liked the pacing. It does not seems to rushed, and yet a lot of things happen. Another perfect episode."
THIS EPISODE SLAPS ASS
"[list]<br />
[*]The soundtrack always makes me super nostalgic. Sends me right back to the late 2000s.<br />
[*]I&#039;m like 99% sure that scene between Uryu and his father wasn&#039;t in the manga. Uryu was basically absent for a good chunk of the manga until he just randomly appeared much later on. It&#039;s good that they&#039;re filling in the blanks a little.<br />
[*][s]Where are the lieutenants?![/s] This episode was supposed to open up with all the lieutenants discussing the disappearances in Rukongai. I was so excited to finally see Rukia and Renji again.<br />
[*]Quilge is mega-annoying, lol. I&#039;m just waiting for them to be done with him at this point.<br />
[/list]<br />
<br />
[s]All in all, I kind of knew this episode was going to be a bit of a slow one (knowing which chapters they were adapting, roughly speaking)[/s] but it&#039;s also the one that saw perhaps the most changes from the manga so far. They cut out a lot of stuff here, and it&#039;s kind of a bummer that one of those happened to be a scene I was really looking forward to.<br />
<br />
Alright, never mind, the ending more than made up for an otherwise slow-ish episode. And we actually did get a glimpse at all the lieutenants as well as the new seated officers. Kira got f*cked up. I had not expected half of that stuff to happen until Episode 4! Well, this confirms that next week should be packed full of action then. Very excited!<br />
<br />
I was going to give this a 3/5 but the last few minutes bump it up to a 4/5 easy."
This Anime version is just so much superior to manga version. Loving it so much. Btw ed theme is better than the op theme 🔥🔥

Rest assured, I&#039;ll be among the first to complain about the animation if they phone it in during some of the most hyped-up fights of this arc. But for Quilge, honestly, they could have done the entire fight off-screen for all I care. He adds nothing of value."

WIT STUDIO and ufotable have spoiled everyone, lol. Not that much happened in this episode, so I&#039;m not sure why you were expecting them to blow their entire animation budget to spin the camera around pointlessly when Yamamoto is looking out of a building to add more animation frames and make it more dynamic.<br />
<br />
There are some really cool fights coming up and I&#039;m sure that&#039;s part of the reason they&#039;re being conservative with their budget in slower episodes like this one. So you can relax. It will be okay, trust me."
"Damn, felt bad for Yamamoto ....especially with his lieutenant gone. Even those short glimpses of them together was sad.<br />
<br />
The story Pesche told to Ichigo and his friends was kinda terrifying. Still, seeing characters like him and Nel bought back a lot of nostalgia. This episode really isn&#039;t holding back to show how brutal the Wandenreich are. Once again, I am quite impressed on what was shown this episode.<br />
"
"Nel is so freaking adorable. I missed her so much. She&#039;s still so small and adorable. And, her Itsigo always gets me. And, I love how Ichigo still treats her like a child. That&#039;s cute. Aside from that, the Quincy King is brutal AF. Sasakibe... :&#039;( Vueco Mundo is in trouble. Also, Hannibel is not looking good.<br />
<br />
Man... no censorship does feel good. Great to see Urahara back. He looks fine as ever. LOL. The OP was good but I prefer the ED a little bit more. Excited for the next episode. "
"Man Yhwach is super savage, nevermind the enemies, he&#039;s blowing away his own comrades like it&#039;s the most fun thing in the world. Also hey always use present tense when talking to him, because this man absolutely loathes anything concerned with the future.<br />
<br />
Plenty of old faces making their return, though not going to lie it&#039;s Urahara with his age old impeccable timing to barge in a conversation took the cake. Ichigo&#039;s in Hueco Mundo and things about to go bonkers in Soul society. Peak Hype.<br />
<br />
Okay opening and ending, though it&#039;s the visuals making their presence feel. Pierrot doing some unusual good work a sight for sore eyes.<br />
"
"AMAZING EPISODE!<br />
I love the OPED! Never heard anything from SennaRin before. Has that Hiroyuki Sawano touch you can clearly hear. Tatsuya Kitani is one of my favorites."

"Opening song is great and Ending song is good as well, visuals are beautiful!<br />

Yhwach doesn&#039;t give a damn about these arrancars, he only care about Quincies. Yamamoto &amp; his lieutenant silent farewell was heart breaking, anime did an amazing job. Urahara is back!<br />
J is here, and he defeated the sisters easily! Now we will have ichigo vs J in next episode.<br />

However paired to that, they are omitting some bits of extra info that, albeit not really necessary, kinda made for a bigger impact for Sasakibe&#039;s death (like the little exchange between Byakuya and Renji during the funeral talking about how much this is affecting Genryuusai).

Thanks for that information.  I found it enlightening and think it is somewhat important especially for we anime onlys.  I speculated on why they sent novice shinigami&#039;s to Katakura Town from the beginning and thought it was to keep Ichigo informed.  I was also kind of worried about Genryuusai. "
"There was one awkward little transition in the second half of the episode but the rest of the episode was well directed for the most part, some nice shots, usage and restraint even when it comes to music, and animation and storyboarding for most of the episode. Got some nostalgia seeing some old characters again too, alongside Hueco Mundo being showcased again, albeit in a brutal situation with Harribel in big trouble after being captured by Yhwach. Opening and ending songs aren&#039;t Bleach&#039;s best if you look at all the songs from the original anime compared to these newer ones and maybe a tad underwhelming because of that (Rapport last week was awesome though for the special ED), but they aren&#039;t too bad either.<br />
<br />
Overall, this episode was nothing special but it was decent enough to watch to continue from the previous week while building the conflicts and build to war with the Soul Reapers and the Quincies. Yhwach looks intimidating here, which is nice and the bloodiness and lack of censorship here is a good touch too. Pacing was good too, feels way more watchable so far than most of Bleach when it comes purely to pacing."
"OP and ED are nice <br />
<br />
nice to see Nel and Urahara again<br />

the Quincy King vs Halibel was a nice added filler <br />

there it is the Quincies are the final enemy and Orihime really got bigger boobs now <br />

<br />
Like, the thing is, it&#039;s not really ever confirmed iirc, just heavily implied even in the anime, except without Ishida&#039;s directly addressing that it may just be the case. So if you especulated as much, that already means it&#039;s not something that couldn&#039;t get trimmed, aka, non-essential. Still was nice to have it spelled outright, since it&#039;s always a cool extra showing Ishida did consider as much. <br />
<br />
As for Sasakibe&#039;s funeral, there was some little trivia during the exchange with Renji talking about how it was the first time he used his bankai and how strong and important to Genryuusai he was, but then again, it&#039;s not exactly essential overall, you can surely see how devastated the poor old man look, and the other info was just trivia, about him, that made the impact a bit heavier. <br />
<br />
Other than those two scenes, the only thing they trimmed was some little bits of comedy that I actually think it was a good idea to take away, since they were a little bit of mood-whiplashes in the scenes they were in (particularly the ringtone with the novice shinigami&#039;s senpai&#039;s voice (which made her blush) when, well, the atmosphere was supposed to be more somber and talk about the hundreds of dead shinigamis lol)."
"[quote=devito1 message=67743350]I liked it, but why is Nel&rsquo;s hair a different color? Wasn&rsquo;t it like a lighter blue instead of green before?[/quote] It&rsquo;s always been green in the manga, the studio is matching the manga perfectly."
"there was a fraction of Sakuga in this episode, but it was insane. Loved it. Can&#039;t wait for Ichigo vs Quilge and the Invasion."
"Another GOATed episode and easy 5/5 from nu-BLEACH. The Wandenreich&#039;s swift conquest of Hueco Mundo is a powerful display of their position as a more dangerous, ruthless and oppressive force than any seen before. The Quincy see Hollows/Arrancar as lesser creatures and their Emperor is brutal. But at least we got to see adorable Nel and our favourite scientist/candy shop man in an otherwise dark episode. The Sternritters also managed to leave an emotional scar on Yamamoto in order to make an ostentious and symbolic declaration of war against the Shinigami and I can&#039;t wait to see him enact his vengeance.<br />
<br />
The visuals were obviously gorgeous and we saw some incredible sakuga. It&#039;s great to see the pacing continuing to be insane whilst adding content. The OP &amp; ED are clean too and I love the aestheticism of the former, especially the reference it makes to this manga colour spread of the Sternritters:<br />
<br />

Looks really amazing yet again. The uncensoring feels so good to watch. Yhwach is as cold as ever. It&rsquo;s great to see Hueco Mundo and Harribel again. The OP and ED ARE SO GOOD !! I need more episodes !!!

Another fantastic episode. Nice to see more familiar faces returning like Urahara and the Squad Captains. More top tier animation during the action sequences as well. And shout out to Tatsuya Kitani for another banger with that OP song.

Build up is amazing and showing how ywach is broken
"Quilge epic as expected. The voice actor delivered him perfectly and the fight of the Jagdarmee against the Tres Bestias was better than what I thought it would be since it wasn&#039;t anything major, just some supporting characters against mooks. Hope his fight against Ichigo ends being epic."
Peak. Need the next episode now.
"It&#039;s been two episode and i feel like bleach has lost it comedic sense. Yes, there are some smol portion of gags but it doesn&#039;t even had the funny ost anymore :( <br />

"Animation is clean as fuck, and I like that they are not censuring the fights and they are as brutal as they were in the manga."
"HOLY SHIT! THE ANIMATION IS OVERKILL.<br />
Loved this episode.<br />
Lol Pesche is voiced by Takehito who also does Dio and Takasugi and Quilge is Utsuro. Also, I can never unhear Sakamoto&#039;s voice in Urahara. I am currently watching Gintama and Bleach so can&#039;t get over it right now. <br />
They increased the gore and no one can tell this is the same Bleach we used to watch.<br />
I love how they changed the atmosphere to dark and depressing and they skipped few comedic scenes and used next to no music to manage the pacing of the show. The director is clearly serious about the show&#039;s pacing and it is very nice. It doesn&#039;t feel out of place. If the original Bleach had this kind of pacing...<br />
Overall a Solid 5/5 episode."
ฺBleach is very nice to follow.
"[quote=begija message=67743359][quote=devito1 message=67743350]I liked it, but why is Nel&rsquo;s hair a different color? Wasn&rsquo;t it like a lighter blue instead of green before?[/quote]<br />

<br />
They made it look more grim and depressing matching the dark atmosphere of this arc. I&#039;d say this is an extremely great choice. Plus they even skipped few comedic scenes to stabilize the pacing of the show."
"I like the opening song, and RIP Sasakibe <br />
<br />
yoo Nel is back again, I haven&#039;t seen Nel in a long time, as usual her behavior is very funny and cute."
"Another fantastic Bleach episode.<br />
<br />
The gore surprised me, but it demonstrates how evil Yhwach is, killing not only his enemies but also his comrades.<br />
<br />
It was upsetting to see Ichigo and his friends learn of Tadaoki Sasakibe&#039;s death. It was also heartbreaking to witness his funeral. He was kneeling to his captain, Genrysai Shigekuni, in an emotional gesture.<br />
<br />
Despite the depressing elements, we did get to see the return of the goat, Urahara, and Nel."
"I like the OP and ED more and more.<br />
So icihigo,inoue,chad, nel is also back are going to Hueco mundo.<br />

True, the theme is indeed war but it wouldn&#039;t change bleach as a whole you know, like the scene where nel closed ichigo&#039;s eyes are comedic relief. This shows that even the theme arc is war, it doesn&#039;t need to be serious all the time. This is shonen after all. <br />
<br />
My point is i kinda felt strange when the gag did not followed by a funky ost lmao just like this one https://youtu.be/C7NJ7IaGjYM"
"i think by the episode and if you didn&#039;t read the manga (like me) you understand what&#039;s going to happen and i&#039;am kind of excited for the next episode as i&#039;am starting to understand this era<br />
<br />
love the opening btw"
sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
"I have a question,why in sasakibes funeral, in the Manga byakuya talks about him and he&#039;s achievements and stuff, in the eps the only word was &quot;light the fire&quot; from yamamoto, what happened to that speech about him?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also yhwach scene with jugram when talking about ebrens medallion, there was so meny changes like yhwach&#039;s position and he&#039;s respond<br />
<br />
+the op was great but to much spoilers<br />
Either then that the eps gets 5/5<br />
<br />
But with these problems I&#039;d give it a 4, also that yhwach scene could&#039;ve used better animation"
"Another great episode<br />
BLEACH continues to entertain us"
"I&#039;m impressed by the quantity of blood and in general, the violence....loved it! This shows that the vision for this arc is more mature and for an adult target-audience, also the music! ah! 10/10"

"This episode left me speechless! Chainsaw man, Attack on titan, One piece... they may be the best of the best, and I enjoy them but... none of them feels like Bleach. True masterpiece!"
"Incredible episode<br />
Hueco Mundo is so nostalgic, and these villains are all insane"
"The opening and ending song got me hype<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s wonderful to see Urahara again. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting Sasakibe to die, but he was at least able to tell them about some of the enemy&rsquo;s power. I love how they&rsquo;re showing everything. Censorship won&rsquo;t be easy for this season. And our girl, Nel, has returned!! It was a fantastic episode. I can hardly wait for the next one."
absolutely incredible 
One of the best anime ever!
"[quote=dragynfaerie message=67743259][quote=Danpmss message=67743177]<br />
<br />
However paired to that, they are omitting some bits of extra info that, albeit not really necessary, kinda made for a bigger impact for Sasakibe&#039;s death (like the little exchange between Byakuya and Renji during the funeral talking about how much this is affecting Genryuusai). Another one that was unfortunately not present is Ishida&#039;s speculation that they may have sent the novice shinigami to Karakura on purpose in order to keep Ichigo informed and have him help in case things went very wrong. <br />
<br />
All of which are not essential, but kinda still are cool bits of info and food for thought, but hey, nothing that actually damages anything, and they only have 4 cours for 20+ volumes.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Thanks for that information.  I think that is kind of impt actually, especially for we anime onlys.  I&#039;ve speculating on why they sent novice shinigami and had the same thought.<br />
[/quote]<br />
no worries regarding the first part about Yamamoto. Cant spoil ofcourse, so thats all I will say."
"A great second episode continuing on from a stellar start to the season, hope it continues"
"Such a great episode! The OST was amazing, like I think it&#039;s top quality OST! Also I liked the Opie charactter, he seems much more interesting than in the manga, where he was portrayed a bit differently. Overall, everything is amazing!!! It will be a great arc!"
"This episodes was soo good too I wasn&#039;t even expecting this to be so good Animation, Pacing and OST&#039;s are Top Tier really fantastic and the fact that nothing seems to be censored at all (Anime only watcher here)"
"2nd ep alot weaker than the first one tbh :/<br />

This was quite gory tho i loved that part<br />

mt foda slk pica dmssssss
You guys must be very hyped the anime&#039;s note is 9.10 lol
"i pointed at reddit and ill write the same here. so let me point the only negative one..the rest are top notch. Pace. It doesnt look like bleach and the scenes dont make empathise with the characters. They change so fast, it is so rushed. They miss details which made love bleach.i cannot even comprehend one scene and they go to another.Havent seen a anime fight faster than sternitter j against the 3 hannibel girls . Showing 2 scenes with the captains out of blue.. Probably the manga wasnt written very well. I wished they made it like 60 episodes so each scene would have a feel. So many things happened at once. I hope Ichigo vs Quilge has its moments"
"If they keep up this animation every episode, I don&#039;t really care how the cours are spaced out."
the bleach be bleachin i guess

<br />
Good ducking job, Disney. Great. Fantastic job. "
"someone is gonna get fired by Disney for leaking this shit lol<br />
<br />
old man Yamamoto being badass, the animation quality is movie like for sure at least on the same movie quality of past Bleach movies, the 3DCG Hollows are done well too <br />
<br />
im not sure if they can maintain this awesome animation quality all through out but i hope they do, first few episodes of any anime usually are best animated anyway <br />
<br />
i forgot most of the story now since its been years that i read the manga but ye i remember the Quincies can nullify the Bankais <br />
<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/DYdEJlN.png[/img]"
The production quality is top tier and that was a great start but damn boy this getting leaked is gonna have heavy consequences.
"Damn production, animaton and shots were awsome, a great start for TYBW. Sad that it got leaked."
"This was an awesome episode, great OST, and animation but shame it got leaked, i mean shame for the company"
that cgi on the hollows tho
"The Episode was great!! Animation and th story! Really hope it will maintain the quality until the end!<br />
<br />
On the other hand about the ep [spoiler]really was thinking ichigo about to lose his bankai form when he just gained back his soul reaper powers in the Fulbringer arc, well gald it&#039;s not like that and existence of  Quinces, really curious about that.[/spoiler]I am really interested for the next ep!"
INCREDIBLE THE BEST ANIME EVER
"Wonderful! Subarashi!<br />
<br />
In an instant you are celebrating the return of Ichigo and Cia. and suddenly it goes into action, mystery and a new enemy<br />
<br />
I&#039;m already looking forward to the second episode!! kekeke"
"The episode is okay, and the animation improved, but the fact that this the Orihime in the episode diminishes. Ichigo&#039;s voice actor has diminished over the years."
"It was Viz that leaked the EP, not Disney. Sorry. This is the same content shown during the prescreening process.<br />

"I haven&#039;t watched the episode yet, but I can already tell this is the strongest start to an anime this (stacked) season. And it&#039;s obvious at this point that this anime will be an aesthetic masterpiece just like the manga.<br />
<br />
Bleach downplayers can end themselves now. It&#039;s over.<br />
<br />
<br />
[b]Edit:[/b] What an absolutely perfect fucking first episode. Mobilised and focused pacing that established all the plot points I wanted from Bleach&#039;s entrance with us getting to see the main cast in the Hollow fight, the introduction of Esbern to establish the presence of a looming and shadowy Quincy threat, and of course the Quincy making their declaration of war against the Shinigami by blasting the dead lieutenant of the First Division into the Head Captain&#039;s barracks before his eyes. The animation looks great and I look forward to the sakuga in the upcoming major fights (we even saw dynamic camera movements in Ichigo&#039;s fight with Esbern), the Hollow CGI is barely noticeable and which the gorgeous compositioning and lighting does favours for, the music and sound effects never miss with this series, amazing backgrounds, and of course Ichigo&#039;s black Getsuga is peakino. A decade-long anticipated high-profile title deserves nothing less. Bleachchads just keep on WINNING!"
It&#039;s looking very good I hope the rest is like this too
"I had to laugh when Getsuga Tensho caused that big ass explosion for absolutely no reason other than because it was meant to look cool. Screw continuity and logic though I guess. Did Michael Bay direct this episode? Lol.<br />

Just because it&#039;s not consistent doesn&#039;t mean it doesn&#039;t explode.  It&#039;s a condensed form of reiatsu. It does cause explosions. When Ichigo clashed with Aizen in FKT for the first time the Getsuga tensho pieces alone were exploding all over the city."

Yeah, and when the condensed reiatsu gets a bit shaky it can explode. Isshin&#039;s Getsugatensho is a reiatsu-flame slash that also can also explode into a wide amount of reiatsu.<br />

Bleach is back!!!
THE BEST - BANKAI !!!!!!!!!!!
waited 10 years or more to hear bankai once again. worth it.
"Watched without subs as at torrents there are no english options so far.<br />
<br />
FIRE! Episode.<br />
The introduction of main cast in the style of pink/purple color like in Akudama Drive.<br />
Ebern fight.<br />
Declaration of War.<br />
Damn <br />
<br />
And the long ending with Whole Rapport song from Bleach Ex Trailer with edited short recap of whole canon bleach episodes... Man I&#039;ve cried so hard. We&#039;re eating good finally !"
"I didn&#039;t like the pacing of episode, seems way too fast..."
"That leak is brutal. Good to re-experience nostalgia though with this show returning, even if I&#039;m not a fan of the writing and story of this series and particular arc. I&#039;ve used an Ichigo keychain for 4 and a half years now daily alongside the Assassination Classroom one a month or 2 after I finished Bleach. Crazy to think that I was in high school then and now I&#039;m in uni, continents away from where I used to live and am just getting older and older as time flies. Good to have it back though despite the messy story, Bleach deserves to have a complete anime too. Will re-watch the premiere whenever the dub arrives, hopefully very soon. The color palette is a bit timid but it looks pretty solid overall and a nice, fresh update to its style from how it looked for the majority of its run previously."
"[quote=Emersonsm message=67669652]I didn&#039;t like the pacing of episode, seems way to fast...[/quote] It is perfect, maybe the slow pacing in the original bleach might have effected your viewing experience "
Finally bleach is back and what a start. The animation and Ost are just brilliant. Dont care what people say but this is the best start we have this fall. After 10 years I can finally say that this lives up to the hype.

The pacing is naturally going to be faster, they&#039;re adapting 200+ chapters in 48-50 approximate episodes and there&#039;s no filler or reason for the anime to just stagnate as the original had to keep on pace with the manga while the anime has all the material it needs to adapt without worrying about catching up too much to the manga."

He&#039;s even putting the manga volume&#039;s poem at the end of every episode, which is something important the first anime didn&#039;t had.<br />

"What an incredible quality of animation Bleach is receiving the treatment it deserved since the beginning of the work back in 2004. I really liked episode 1 competent animation and the great soundtrack. I also really liked the ending song. let&#039;s hope this arc maintains the quality until the end in technical terms and I&#039;m also curious about the additions to the story that they said it will have.<br />
For sure BLEACH Thousand Year Blood war is one of the best anime of 2022 I will not miss an episode of this arc during the 4 launch cours. Bleach is in my opinion one of the best Shounens ever made alongside HxH 2011 so I&#039;m looking forward to everything in this final anime arc.<br />
For those who haven&#039;t seen anything from the manga, wait for many revelations and epic fights in this final saga."
the animation and the soundtrack is a 10/10
"masterpiece on another level<br />
"
"Over 10 years and we&#039;re finally back! I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d ever be so hyped for a Shounen again, but I guess Bleach is just Bleach. Ichigo&#039;s theme playing during the Hollow fight scene was hype as fuck!"
"While I remember being disappointed with how this arc goes on as an original manga reader, I still was able to enjoy it. <br />
Loved the animation and art and how this arc began!"
"Op episode, like it"
Wow just woww!!! Animation is soo 😭😭🔥🔥🔥 omfg and the ending too!! i love itt 🔥🔥 IchiGOAT IS BACK!!
That Bankai brought in a rush of nostalgia
"insane<br />
now i just need to write enough words for them to let me reply"
"It felt so short, but Bleach is finally back and ready to start with a bang! Ichigo vs Ebern and the Wandenreich&#039;s declaration of war especially were my favorite moments of the episode. The OST by Shiro Sagisu, peak as always.<br />
I enjoyed the episode throughly and it&#039;s a pity we will have to wait a weak, but I&#039;m just happy after so much time I can experience this series again. I&#039;m overjoyed."
"amazing episode, the backgrounds, the cgi, everything<br />
I loved the special ending song with the scenes from the older anime<br />
They old scenes looked they were upscaled or had fx added to them "
"Wow. Bleach is really back after a whole ass decade. It still feels surreal. The animation, Shiro Sagisu returning with more goated music, hearing Number One again, and hearing &quot;BAN....KAI!!!!&quot; and &quot;GETSUGA TENSHOOOOO!!!&quot; again.....this was a fantastic first episode and an amazing return for Bleach. I wouldn&#039;t even call myself a huge fan of Bleach but I&#039;ve always had an appreciation for it and feel like it&#039;s often the most disrespected of the &quot;Big 3 Shounen.&quot; Hopefully this will change things. For now I&#039;m just happy that it&#039;s back with upscaled animation. God I&#039;d love to see some of the fights from the OG anime with upscaled animation. Seeing the Naruto 20 year anniversary thing the other day and now this is making me want upscaled remasters of both lol, but that definitely won&#039;t happen.<br />
<br />
Oh yea and RIP to whoever leaked this, better start filing for unemployment 💀💀💀"
"Even though I watched the trailer about a hundred times, I was still in awe at this episode.<br />
Kinda wish they could remake all of Bleach with this kind of animation"

its like with hunter x hunter. woudnt call myself a  super mega fan of it but if it came back, and i saw it in the past ofc i will watch it! :D"
"Okay, I don&#039;t want to be that boring guy, but I had already noticed in the trailer the lack of impressive action scenes, and I also watched this director&#039;s other anime (Akudama Drive) and I got the impression that he&#039;s not very good with actions scenes, does that mean we won&#039;t have good fights? no, but I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to have extremely well animated fights, with impressive camera angles and so on. I hope I&#039;m wrong."
"Im glad it got leaked. Great surprise.<br />
[img]https://i.imgur.com/NTz6j6Z.gif[/img]<br />
That was me watching the episode and also shouting &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Getsuga tenshou&quot; and &quot;Ban... Kai&quot;. Such a hype man.... See ya all in a week and one day if it doesn&#039;t get leaked XD. <br />

"PEAK FICTION, cool animation and it was a good adaption from the manga"

Yes sir anyone who watched the trailers should be able to tell how well done the CG is.<br />

"AOTY has joined the chat. I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s finally here, we&#039;ve missed you so much.. What a phenomenal first episode and first impression of Bleach&#039;s grand return. It looks and sounds great, and Taguchi and Sagisu never miss."
"I just realised the shape on the road was a quincy logo. Didn&#039;t catch that in the manga if it was even there in the first place.<br />

<br />
Also the ending was a nice touch. Quick recap of the first 366 episodes (or less, fillers excluded). I almost cried."

Ah yes, Orihime the pan queen."
"I have no words to describe this feeling... crying, joy, happiness, emotion, nostalgia, my childhood, my life, my being, there are many sensations involved, watching this episode, hearing Ichigo saying BANKAI once again was something similar with the return of Fairy Tail in 2018, it&#039;s an inexplicable thrill"
ICHIGOAT!!!! GOAT GOAT GOAT GOAT
"How can people say the animation looks &#039;OK&#039;. It really does look movie quality, Studio Pierrot really knocked it out of the park"
THIS IS STRAIGHT UP FIRE
in my opinion the drawings were great. ı got a nostagia ıve gone my child time thanks bleach we missed u.
"Amazing first episode.<br />
I AM HYPED."
"Man that is awesome holy moly I am super happy that Bleach is back plus the quality of the animation look so so good I felt watching movie plus the ending man so much memories of watching it <br />
<br />
Can&rsquo;t wait for episode 2 next week"
"I&#039;ve caught up with the manga up until this arc and watched the anime. It has been an enjoyable ride with epic fights and great characters. Now, the animation has improved by a land mile which will make it even better. A great first episode, we&#039;ve got to see a fair amount of characters back who will be in a dangerous spot sooner or later. The soundtrack is fucking fire and overall vibe of the episode with the new artsyle of the adaptation is way too good.<br />
<br />
Goodbye, random employer of Disney. You&#039;ll be missed."
very epic indeed yes
Just watched the English subs again and I just wanted to add one more thing. Its NOT censored. Everyone who said that it will be censored cause of disney and stuff have got their answers now. Its all as brutal as the manga.

The events happen a bit differently so it&#039;s pretty fresh take on the same story."
"i could screenshot like half the episode. truly immaculate art and direction! loved the layouts, the animation was also very nice.<br />
<br />
good start!"
"Off with an almost incredible start. My only complaint and I&#039;m sure other will agree...<br />
<br />
Those CGI Hollows... Really Pierrot? The &quot;fodder&quot; type of Hollows will be barely relevant if not at all anymore at this point. You could&#039;ve given them a decent send off from the show by giving them decent 2D animation, of course the 3D wasn&#039;t bad but still these enemies were the icon of the show in the beginning and deserved better. That&#039;s my rant.<br />
<br />
Everything else is amazing, voice acting, music, animation, on point every other check mark. The ED feels kind of cheap just recapping past events, maybe it&#039;ll change later. "
"I was grounded to the screen, the OST the animation, everything felt so original and so Bleach. That &quot;Principle of defeat&quot; feeling that Bleach and Bleach only gives, priceless. 5/5 and if possible I would have ranked it higher :D"
I Loved it! Nice Animation.
"It got leaked bruh!<br />
<br />
OMG!!! This episode was amazing, I want the next episode now!<br />
The animation is definitely the best it has ever been for bleach. CGI Hollow were great, I don&#039;t think there was any problem there.<br />
The dialogues from Yamamoto were giving me Chills. Orihime is beautiful as ever. Ichigo &amp; his team&#039;s entry was easily the best part fo the episode.<br />
I&#039;m f**king excited for what&#039;s come. If the animation is the same as this for rest of 52 episodes, then it&#039;s going to be peak, because I know what to come in next few episode!"
"As the first episode of the season, I can say that it was a great episode. The studio did a really good job and it looks like they&#039;re going to adapt the manga well. An amazing season awaits us."
"I thought they&#039;d do a recap episode but I&#039;m so glad they didn&#039;t, the episode was amazing! Animation was top tier! "
"the music bro, the music"
"Finally, the anime of the year has started"
"saw the 3d ghouls and was scared, but the special effects more than makes up for it! Super hyped for the season"
Nice animation!!!
"Fanservice aside, it&#039;s good to be back in black!"
"Really strong pilot episode, visuals look great, even the cgi hollows are really well done. Really looking forward to how they adapt this, I hope they don&rsquo;t drag it out like they did with the og.<br />
<br />
Also the music fucking SLAPS."
"Nice leak eh? <br />
<br />
Good lord we&#039;re in for a treat. I was grinning for the whole 20 mins. I&#039;m so, so happy 😁<br />
<br />
"
"It was more impressive than I expected. Amazing how far animation has progressed in during the 9 years hiatus. I am so glad the 8 years I waited paid off. Fantastic art and effects. This is going to be good, or so I think. "
"fantastic, finally back!"
"This is one of my favorite moments being an anime fan. I can&#039;t believe Bleach is finally back, and it looks better than ever. Can&#039;t wait for the rest of this arc to be adapted like this. Let&#039;s GOOOO!!"
