      "First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "watching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community.  Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that it isn't a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn't be nearly as harsh\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "on it if it weren't for the God status the show has attained in America. I would happily remand \"greatest show ever made\" to \"greatest long-running shonen ever made if you haven't seen the 2011 Hunter X Hunter\"\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'm not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I'm going to use it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "STORY: 8\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren't looking at them. It's an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that's one of the marks of strong storytelling.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I've seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they're from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don't-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it's happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I'm not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there's a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn't how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show's ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it's resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "ART: 8\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don't have any real complaints there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes \"anime\" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I'll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There's a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience \"this is the funny part!\"\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that's really what matters. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOUND: 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Undeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It's been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved 'Golden Time Lover' and 'Chemistry', but I have to give special mention to SID's 'Rain'. As far as I'm concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn't quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I believe that there is an intense connection between a show's opening and the audience's willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online's \"Courage\" and Guilty Crown's \"My Dearest\". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU\n",

      "I would definitely call out the show's characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that's not the main issue. It's because most of them are not really characters: they're plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They're entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he'll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they'll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It's not that it's melodrama: it's the fact that it's the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn't until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And that's the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character's only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are \"hates being called short\" and \"hates milk\" they're really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he's even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides \"we must overthrow the government\" and \"Hughes!\" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn't have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that's really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They're far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show's 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they're close to?? What are their personal histories...\n",

      "Oh wait, sorry! I didn't mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...\n",
      "\r\n",

      "TRAUMA\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everyone who's remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It's a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here's the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn't Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of \"my wife left me because we were too poor\" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al's dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry's parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It's basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There's no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he's relatively safe.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They're difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don't make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn't anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a 'good guy' (*cough* Mustang)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don't-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their \"good-guy\" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn't even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an \"Adventures of the Homunculus\" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.\n",

      "ENJOYMENT: 7\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher's stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show's apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I've already said it, but I don't know if I've driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don't-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That's not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That's something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It's character's speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I've already mentioned, they're repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "OVERALL: 7\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It's a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it's definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don't go in with irrational expectations. It's enjoyable, it's engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn't heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it's not by any means a bad show! I don't give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!\n",
      "Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Admittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then there's the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public's opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we'll get to that in a bit.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically \"shounen\" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively \"de-humanised\" by pushing them on to the non human characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn't steal a march on Arakawa. It's possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn't really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Interestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Strangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong's older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn't develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the \"de-humanisation\" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military's generals are concerned.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it's a testament to the quality of not only the actor's abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there's a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don't really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed's character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they're broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it's a testament to Arakawa's skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.\n",
      "Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here's why FMA:B and it's Manga counterpart don't work:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that's objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So why is it disjointed?\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Because there's a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don't mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they're implemented in the story. For example, one second we're dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn't fit. It's formulaic. It's predictable storytelling at it's finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I've ever seen); e.g. Edward's speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I'd hate to say in any other series because pretentiously \"dark and gritty\" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Personally, it just doesn't work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.\n",

Emotions are strong and there's more of a connection between characters then in the original anime, you immediately get dragged into this show within the first 5 minuets, this is honestly one of the most spectacular anime's i've ever laid my eyes on, it's definitely one of the best new shows of the last couple years. Its a definite watch, don't miss out!\n",
      "Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This anime starts off at a breakneck pace.  It shoots entire volumes of the manga in a couple\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "of episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you'll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this \"generic shonen\" label.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al's father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn't feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character's values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn't expect any less.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there's no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.  Overall score: 9.4/10 (rounded to 9).\n",

The emotional scenes aren't forced, they have a really big impact on you as a person. You'll start to relate to every character and even question life. Some examples being \"What is the truth?\" or \"Could humans play the role of god?\" That's why I love this show so much.

I didn't give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That's a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character's have there own unique features that stand out among the rest.

I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don't blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al's actor. Al's original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That's how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you've all been waiting for, the characters.\n",

If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don't want to mess with. He'll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he'll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can't have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won't forgive you. He doesn't forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.\n",

It's kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn't hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There's even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won't spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!\n",

      "What can I say about this show? I never even tried to follow the original anime.. I knew it was a big success and has a lot of followers everywhere. But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job. \r\n",

And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next. \r\n",
      "The voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.\r\n",
      "The sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.\n",

      "\r\n",

      "This is one of those anime that will leave you feeling empty after you finish it. And I mean that in a good way. I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.\n",
      "I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series.

He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Events thereafter eventually culminate in a new mission for the Elrics; to procure the Philosopher's Stone and use it to recreate their own bodies.\n",

      "Sounds like heavy stuff, right?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Storyline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here. A definite 10/10.\n",

      "Enter FMA: Brotherhood. Now this is a spectacular adaptation worthy of the manga; this is the epitome of a masterpiece anime. The series is just the right length; the storyline never drags, or falters. Although FMA:BH is strung together with an incredible strong plot, the characters are the real highlights of the series; the majority of the cast is thoroughly fully fleshed out with dilemmas worthy of our attention.

However, even this flaw is something that anyone can look past, since the show itself is so enjoyable. \n",

All the characters have so much depth that it's impossible to hate a single character of this anime.

      "Sometimes an anime can feel a little off when the art style does not please our eyes, even though the story is actually good, but this is definitely not the case. The art style is really enjoyable and I just loved those round faces!\r\n",
      "The fight scene, don't even get me started! The animation is gorgeous and Bones sure knows how to deliver well-animated fights with amazing angles and details that really make the watcher enjoy what the're watching.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Sound - 10/10\r\n",
      "I can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don't think there's much else to say here, top notch as always.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters - 10/10\r\n",
      "The second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.\r\n",
      "Even the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I've seen so far, that's a +1 right there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment - In case it's not obvious by now, 10/10\r\n",
      "I enjoyed every single episode from this amazing series which left me sitting on the edge of my seat with all the plot-twists and cliffhangers that followed the previous one, that with the awesome animation quality by Bones, beautiful soundtracks and lots of relatable characters with funny, troubled, brave and heartwarming personalities.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall - 10/10\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it's other version's \"awesomness\" and show us what anime truly is about, and that's how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won't be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won't. :)\n",
      "There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMAB is also one of the only anime that I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The voice\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "actors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.\n",
      "This anime is going in the All Time Favourites List along with the other classics, you know like one piece, naruto, bleach, dbz and all that stuff.\r\n",
      "I'm not comparing with them though. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is not exactly like them. It is not the usual 'go on an adventure' type with dozens of episodes and fight scenes that all look the same. FMAB is more story-oriented and tactical.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First, the story is very well wtitten and everything is properly planned out and coincides with each other bringing out every element in the right manner at the right time. The concept is really good with the\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "right blend of fantasy and reality.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the brothers are the focus of the show, each and every character has a role to play and help develop the story accordingly and develop themselves as well. This keeps the viewers alive to every character.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtracks are soo cool. You would love atleast 4 of 'em.\r\n",
      "I am not bothered by animation/art, but it is really good though.\r\n",
      "I also liked the fact that there were some great statements and quotes about life, you know.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not to mention, FMAB is one hilarious anime!! Then a little bit of drama and a little bit of a romance here and there gives it a proper outfit. I could recommend any type of person to watch this anime. For me it has become one of the classics\r\n",
      "I saw this show when I was small and liked it instantly. Because I didn't see it properly I saw it again, and boy, was I glad I did! I loved every bit of it. Now I wouldn't say it doesn't have flaws, but why be a nit-picker when it is so enjoyable. No anime is perfect to everyone's mark afterall, eh\n",
      "Story: Well this story is nothing short of amazing. It is so entertaining, and just interesting to watch. The comedy, and action are outstanding. It all blends in perfectly. Some moments are more breath taking than others, and I mean that in two ways. 1. The comedy often had me in tears, and breathless because of how hard I was laughing, and 2. Heart filled moments just hit you like a damn bus. 10\n",

      "Sound: The ost for this show is perfect. The voice acting for it is also perfect. I don't think I have watched another anime where I love the Japanese voices and the English. Fantastic job from everyone. 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character: Oh my god again perfection. The characters are all great. You basically grow up with Ed, and Al. There physical, and mental transitions are so subtle that you really feel like you are watching them grow. Some anime have time skips where they just skip like seven years and then just throw you in, but not This anime you watch them grow it is amazing. 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment and overall: My enjoyment is through the roof. FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I think is going to stand the fates of time well. I was never bored like I am with some anime. I was always hooked. My enjoyment and overall score are both 10.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that's not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch Fullmetal\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Alchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you'll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters' profile.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters \"got that attitude from\". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I'd prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn't quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I'm just kidding! You probably won't regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can't tell you that for sure - you'll have to see for yourself.\n",
      "I was dreading having to make my way through Brotherhood at some point considering my high regard for the first series and not really liking the manga adaptation's more conventional plot developments. But considering enough people were praising the daylights out of Brotherhood and some even boasting that the first series was no longer relevant, I decided to check things out for myself and see what got people giddy over this adaptation of the series. And after venturing my way through Brotherhood, I would have to say that those calling the first series irrelevant are ridiculous considering both titles have completely different takes on their\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "source material and the handling of them that whichever series you prefer would depend on what you are looking for in an anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Brotherhood's case, it takes the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and makes a more closer adaptation of the source material which is quite focused on world building and creating a grand scale plot coming out of the Elrics finding out details about the Philosopher's Stone and eventually finding out about a national conspiracy and heinous plot connected to the Homunculus and powerful figures in the Amestris military. This take on FMA does follow a more conventional plot than the first TV series as much of the complex characterization found with prominent characters in the original series is greatly toned down with Brotherhood creating a more plot-focused series and morality with many characters being more black and white as the series has more purely \"good\" and \"bad\" characters with the former being always right in their convictions within the series and the latter having no redeemable traits and being wrong in their actions. With me believing that good characters in an anime should be morally grey with flawed heroes and villains with redeemable traits, I wasn't digging Brotherhood's conventional take on characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood did have some elements that I did get some enjoyment out of. With Brotherhood being more focused on world building and plot advancement, the series expands more on the world of the series than what the first series did by introducing more branches of the military and some other countries neighboring Amestris, particularly Xerxes and Xing. This also allows the introduction of some new characters in the series with several characters from Xing and within the military that Ed and Al befriend and ally with when dealing with the Homunculus and the conspiracy they uncover. In addition, some characters from the original series who were underdeveloped and not having much screen time (Hohenheim, Alex Armstrong and Roy Mustang's men being prominent examples) are given more focus in this series, get some moments of fleshing out and are given bigger roles to play.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still though, there are enough issues I have with Brotherhood that outweigh the praises I give it above. The show's first 12-13 episodes run at a fast pace providing little time to connect with characters introduced and with the events of those episodes having been portrayed in the first series, Bones appeared to have intentionally sped through the events to get going with what wasn't covered by the first series. With Bones more closely following the manga's storyline for Brotherhood, these earlier episodes had featured a major flaw to FMA manga-ka Hiromu Arakawa's earlier chapters in that her fast advancement of events gave little time for emotional investment from readers in regards to how characters reacted to major events that shook their resolves as the lack of time and depth on plotting in earlier chapters did kill their quality to a great extent. With the slower pacing and greater character focus found in FMA's first series, Arakawa had adopted these elements to a degree with her storytelling in later chapters which helped improve the quality of her writing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also found myself getting quite irritated with the show's comedy getting in the way of more serious moments. This was quite prominent in Brotherhood's earlier episodes where moments of slapstick and characters going super-deformed killed the suspense of serious moments. While the series does tone down on these moments in later episodes as the plot gets darker and more serious, they still pop up on occasion and when they do, I still found them to be a mood killer during most scenes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite the praises I gave for new characters and expanded depth on underdeveloped characters who appeared in the original series, I couldn't give the same thing for a majority of other characters who appeared in the first series. Brotherhood's portrayal of these characters are more conventional and less complex as heroic characters aren't confronted with any possible flaws to their actions and personal beliefs; as well as all the villains being so shallowly evil that they're laughable and I could care less if they get beaten up and killed off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The final episodes to a good extent also felt quite contrived with how things progress just to allow all the surviving characters to have a good ending. A number of moments were deus ex machina thrown in for villains to be defeated through means which the series never explored and they kind of cheapen how I felt about the hardships faced by the Elrics and other prominent characters to get what they desire.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In terms of presentation, visual details with Brotherhood are a bit simpler than the first series with color tones being more subdued. This is especially prominent with background designs in many shots as their quality looks quite washed out compared to scenery found in the foreground. Still, character designs of those from the original series still look the same as they were from over five years ago. While animation shortcuts are apparent in a good number of shots in Brotherhood, the series does have its animation highlights with the occasional fluid fight sequence and some good fight scenes involving Envy's true form.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For music, much of Brotherhood's insert music consists of stringed and piano pieces that do well at complementing the peaceful and intense moments seen throughout the series. On the other hand, many of the OP and ED musical choices chosen for the series consisted of some generic J-Pop and J-Rock that hardly grabbed my interest, though the first OP, Yui's again, did well at fitting with Brotherhood's mood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I found my perceptions of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be no different from when I read the manga. It goes for a more conventional style of storytelling compared to the first FMA series and while it does have its moments of good quality involving character focus and world building, its more plot heavy and conventional focus drives it to lose much of the complexity given to prominent characters of the first series and the poor quality to its plotting in its beginning and ending episodes does kill quite a bit of the plot buildup that I would be expected to care about. While a worthwhile watch to those craving an epic-style action-adventure series or wanting a more faithful adaptation of the FMA manga, those wanting better characterization and solid drama with the series (in my case) would be better off seeing the 2003 anime adaptation of FMA.\n"

      "First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "watching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community.  Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that it isn't a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn't be nearly as harsh\n",
      "                  ...\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I'm not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I'm going to use it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "STORY: 8\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren't looking at them. It's an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that's one of the marks of strong storytelling.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I've seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they're from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don't-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it's happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I'm not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there's a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn't how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show's ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it's resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "ART: 8\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don't have any real complaints there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes \"anime\" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I'll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There's a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience \"this is the funny part!\"\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that's really what matters. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOUND: 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Undeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It's been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved 'Golden Time Lover' and 'Chemistry', but I have to give special mention to SID's 'Rain'. As far as I'm concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn't quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.\n",

      "I believe that there is an intense connection between a show's opening and the audience's willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online's \"Courage\" and Guilty Crown's \"My Dearest\". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU\n",

      "I would definitely call out the show's characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that's not the main issue. It's because most of them are not really characters: they're plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They're entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he'll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they'll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It's not that it's melodrama: it's the fact that it's the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn't until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And that's the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character's only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are \"hates being called short\" and \"hates milk\" they're really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he's even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides \"we must overthrow the government\" and \"Hughes!\" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn't have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that's really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They're far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show's 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they're close to?? What are their personal histories...\n",

      "TRAUMA\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everyone who's remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It's a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here's the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn't Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of \"my wife left me because we were too poor\" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al's dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry's parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It's basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There's no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he's relatively safe.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They're difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don't make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn't anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a 'good guy' (*cough* Mustang)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don't-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their \"good-guy\" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn't even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an \"Adventures of the Homunculus\" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.\n",

      "ENJOYMENT: 7\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher's stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show's apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I've already said it, but I don't know if I've driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don't-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That's not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That's something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It's character's speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I've already mentioned, they're repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "OVERALL: 7\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It's a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it's definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don't go in with irrational expectations. It's enjoyable, it's engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn't heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it's not by any means a bad show! I don't give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!\n",
      "Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Admittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then there's the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public's opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we'll get to that in a bit.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically \"shounen\" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively \"de-humanised\" by pushing them on to the non human characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn't steal a march on Arakawa. It's possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn't really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Interestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Strangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong's older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn't develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the \"de-humanisation\" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military's generals are concerned.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it's a testament to the quality of not only the actor's abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there's a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don't really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed's character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they're broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it's a testament to Arakawa's skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.\n",
      "Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here's why FMA:B and it's Manga counterpart don't work:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that's objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So why is it disjointed?\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Because there's a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don't mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they're implemented in the story. For example, one second we're dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn't fit. It's formulaic. It's predictable storytelling at it's finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I've ever seen); e.g. Edward's speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I'd hate to say in any other series because pretentiously \"dark and gritty\" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Personally, it just doesn't work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.\n",

      "I can't even watch the original FMA anime now that I'm currently watching Brotherhood! This is a NO FILLER anime it gets straight to the point with it's beautiful animation and amazing portrayal of the manga, everything is so different! Emotions are strong and there's more of a connection between characters then in the original anime, you immediately get dragged into this show within the first 5 minuets, this is honestly one of the most spectacular anime's i've ever laid my eyes on, it's definitely one of the best new shows of the last couple years. Its a definite watch, don't miss out!\n",
      "Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.\n",

      "                  ...\n",
      "of episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you'll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this \"generic shonen\" label.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al's father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn't feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character's values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn't expect any less.\n",

      "Overall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there's no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.  Overall score: 9.4/10 (rounded to 9).\n",

The emotional scenes aren't forced, they have a really big impact on you as a person. You'll start to relate to every character and even question life.

I didn't give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That's a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character's have there own unique features that stand out among the rest.

I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don't blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al's actor. Al's original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That's how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you've all been waiting for, the characters.\n",

If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don't want to mess with. He'll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he'll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can't have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won't forgive you. He doesn't forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.\n",

It's kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn't hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There's even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won't spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!\n",

But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job. \r\n",

And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next. \r\n",
      "The voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.\r\n",
      "The sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.\n",

I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.\n",
      "I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series.

He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor.

      "Sounds like heavy stuff, right?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Storyline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here. A definite 10/10.\n",

      "Enter FMA: Brotherhood. Now this is a spectacular adaptation worthy of the manga; this is the epitome of a masterpiece anime. The series is just the right length; the storyline never drags, or falters. Although FMA:BH is strung together with an incredible strong plot, the characters are the real highlights of the series; the majority of the cast is thoroughly fully fleshed out with dilemmas worthy of our attention.

However, even this flaw is something that anyone can look past, since the show itself is so enjoyable. \n",

All the characters have so much depth that it's impossible to hate a single character of this anime.

      "                  ...\n",
      "meet Hiromu Arakawa and thank her for having an amazing imagination and ability to create and draw this masterpiece. You may be thinking \"Another fanboy, better find a real review\", and well, maybe you're right, but I have to praise what deserves to be praised, and this certaninly does.\r\n",
      " Sure you can say the first episodes were a bit rushed, but wouldn't people still complain if they had slowed it down instead? For me the pacing of the story felt natural and that they did not need to waste the beginning of the series explaining the story since it is slowly explained as the anime progresses.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Art - 10/10\r\n",
      "Sometimes an anime can feel a little off when the art style does not please our eyes, even though the story is actually good, but this is definitely not the case. The art style is really enjoyable and I just loved those round faces!\r\n",
      "The fight scene, don't even get me started! The animation is gorgeous and Bones sure knows how to deliver well-animated fights with amazing angles and details that really make the watcher enjoy what the're watching.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Sound - 10/10\r\n",
      "I can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don't think there's much else to say here, top notch as always.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters - 10/10\r\n",
      "The second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.\r\n",
      "Even the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I've seen so far, that's a +1 right there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment - In case it's not obvious by now, 10/10\r\n",
      "I enjoyed every single episode from this amazing series which left me sitting on the edge of my seat with all the plot-twists and cliffhangers that followed the previous one, that with the awesome animation quality by Bones, beautiful soundtracks and lots of relatable characters with funny, troubled, brave and heartwarming personalities.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall - 10/10\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it's other version's \"awesomness\" and show us what anime truly is about, and that's how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won't be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won't. :)\n",
      "There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMAB is also one of the only anime that I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The voice\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "actors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.\n",
      "This anime is going in the All Time Favourites List along with the other classics, you know like one piece, naruto, bleach, dbz and all that stuff.\r\n",
      "I'm not comparing with them though. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is not exactly like them. It is not the usual 'go on an adventure' type with dozens of episodes and fight scenes that all look the same. FMAB is more story-oriented and tactical.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First, the story is very well wtitten and everything is properly planned out and coincides with each other bringing out every element in the right manner at the right time. The concept is really good with the\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "right blend of fantasy and reality.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the brothers are the focus of the show, each and every character has a role to play and help develop the story accordingly and develop themselves as well. This keeps the viewers alive to every character.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtracks are soo cool. You would love atleast 4 of 'em.\r\n",
      "I am not bothered by animation/art, but it is really good though.\r\n",
      "I also liked the fact that there were some great statements and quotes about life, you know.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not to mention, FMAB is one hilarious anime!! Then a little bit of drama and a little bit of a romance here and there gives it a proper outfit. I could recommend any type of person to watch this anime. For me it has become one of the classics\r\n",
      "I saw this show when I was small and liked it instantly. Because I didn't see it properly I saw it again, and boy, was I glad I did! I loved every bit of it. Now I wouldn't say it doesn't have flaws, but why be a nit-picker when it is so enjoyable. No anime is perfect to everyone's mark afterall, eh\n",
      "Story: Well this story is nothing short of amazing. It is so entertaining, and just interesting to watch. The comedy, and action are outstanding. It all blends in perfectly. Some moments are more breath taking than others, and I mean that in two ways. 1. The comedy often had me in tears, and breathless because of how hard I was laughing, and 2. Heart filled moments just hit you like a damn bus. 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art: Oh my god the art is great. I am sure there were some flaws, because there are flaws in everything, but honestly if there were flaws I never caught them. The\n",

      "character design is great, but even just the scenery is fantastic. 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound: The ost for this show is perfect. The voice acting for it is also perfect. I don't think I have watched another anime where I love the Japanese voices and the English. Fantastic job from everyone. 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character: Oh my god again perfection. The characters are all great. You basically grow up with Ed, and Al. There physical, and mental transitions are so subtle that you really feel like you are watching them grow. Some anime have time skips where they just skip like seven years and then just throw you in, but not This anime you watch them grow it is amazing. 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment and overall: My enjoyment is through the roof. FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I think is going to stand the fates of time well. I was never bored like I am with some anime. I was always hooked. My enjoyment and overall score are both 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you haven't watched this series I really really really recommend you dive in, and just let it hit you all at once.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that's not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch Fullmetal\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Alchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you'll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters' profile.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters \"got that attitude from\". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I'd prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn't quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I'm just kidding! You probably won't regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can't tell you that for sure - you'll have to see for yourself.\n",
      "I was dreading having to make my way through Brotherhood at some point considering my high regard for the first series and not really liking the manga adaptation's more conventional plot developments. But considering enough people were praising the daylights out of Brotherhood and some even boasting that the first series was no longer relevant, I decided to check things out for myself and see what got people giddy over this adaptation of the series. And after venturing my way through Brotherhood, I would have to say that those calling the first series irrelevant are ridiculous considering both titles have completely different takes on their\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "source material and the handling of them that whichever series you prefer would depend on what you are looking for in an anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Brotherhood's case, it takes the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and makes a more closer adaptation of the source material which is quite focused on world building and creating a grand scale plot coming out of the Elrics finding out details about the Philosopher's Stone and eventually finding out about a national conspiracy and heinous plot connected to the Homunculus and powerful figures in the Amestris military. This take on FMA does follow a more conventional plot than the first TV series as much of the complex characterization found with prominent characters in the original series is greatly toned down with Brotherhood creating a more plot-focused series and morality with many characters being more black and white as the series has more purely \"good\" and \"bad\" characters with the former being always right in their convictions within the series and the latter having no redeemable traits and being wrong in their actions. With me believing that good characters in an anime should be morally grey with flawed heroes and villains with redeemable traits, I wasn't digging Brotherhood's conventional take on characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood did have some elements that I did get some enjoyment out of. With Brotherhood being more focused on world building and plot advancement, the series expands more on the world of the series than what the first series did by introducing more branches of the military and some other countries neighboring Amestris, particularly Xerxes and Xing. This also allows the introduction of some new characters in the series with several characters from Xing and within the military that Ed and Al befriend and ally with when dealing with the Homunculus and the conspiracy they uncover. In addition, some characters from the original series who were underdeveloped and not having much screen time (Hohenheim, Alex Armstrong and Roy Mustang's men being prominent examples) are given more focus in this series, get some moments of fleshing out and are given bigger roles to play.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still though, there are enough issues I have with Brotherhood that outweigh the praises I give it above. The show's first 12-13 episodes run at a fast pace providing little time to connect with characters introduced and with the events of those episodes having been portrayed in the first series, Bones appeared to have intentionally sped through the events to get going with what wasn't covered by the first series. With Bones more closely following the manga's storyline for Brotherhood, these earlier episodes had featured a major flaw to FMA manga-ka Hiromu Arakawa's earlier chapters in that her fast advancement of events gave little time for emotional investment from readers in regards to how characters reacted to major events that shook their resolves as the lack of time and depth on plotting in earlier chapters did kill their quality to a great extent. With the slower pacing and greater character focus found in FMA's first series, Arakawa had adopted these elements to a degree with her storytelling in later chapters which helped improve the quality of her writing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also found myself getting quite irritated with the show's comedy getting in the way of more serious moments. This was quite prominent in Brotherhood's earlier episodes where moments of slapstick and characters going super-deformed killed the suspense of serious moments. While the series does tone down on these moments in later episodes as the plot gets darker and more serious, they still pop up on occasion and when they do, I still found them to be a mood killer during most scenes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite the praises I gave for new characters and expanded depth on underdeveloped characters who appeared in the original series, I couldn't give the same thing for a majority of other characters who appeared in the first series. Brotherhood's portrayal of these characters are more conventional and less complex as heroic characters aren't confronted with any possible flaws to their actions and personal beliefs; as well as all the villains being so shallowly evil that they're laughable and I could care less if they get beaten up and killed off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The final episodes to a good extent also felt quite contrived with how things progress just to allow all the surviving characters to have a good ending. A number of moments were deus ex machina thrown in for villains to be defeated through means which the series never explored and they kind of cheapen how I felt about the hardships faced by the Elrics and other prominent characters to get what they desire.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In terms of presentation, visual details with Brotherhood are a bit simpler than the first series with color tones being more subdued. This is especially prominent with background designs in many shots as their quality looks quite washed out compared to scenery found in the foreground. Still, character designs of those from the original series still look the same as they were from over five years ago. While animation shortcuts are apparent in a good number of shots in Brotherhood, the series does have its animation highlights with the occasional fluid fight sequence and some good fight scenes involving Envy's true form.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For music, much of Brotherhood's insert music consists of stringed and piano pieces that do well at complementing the peaceful and intense moments seen throughout the series. On the other hand, many of the OP and ED musical choices chosen for the series consisted of some generic J-Pop and J-Rock that hardly grabbed my interest, though the first OP, Yui's again, did well at fitting with Brotherhood's mood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I found my perceptions of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be no different from when I read the manga. It goes for a more conventional style of storytelling compared to the first FMA series and while it does have its moments of good quality involving character focus and world building, its more plot heavy and conventional focus drives it to lose much of the complexity given to prominent characters of the first series and the poor quality to its plotting in its beginning and ending episodes does kill quite a bit of the plot buildup that I would be expected to care about. While a worthwhile watch to those craving an epic-style action-adventure series or wanting a more faithful adaptation of the FMA manga, those wanting better characterization and solid drama with the series (in my case) would be better off seeing the 2003 anime adaptation of FMA.\n",
      "Full metal alchemist brotherhood the anime that has been called a masterpiece for so many years well to day I'm here to tell you my thoughts on that.Many people feel this way because it strictly follows the manga but just because an anime follows the manga doesn't necessarily mean its good.\n",

      "Story- Now I will spoil some of the story in this review. FMAB started off pretty good then I realized a lot of stuff was not being explained the pacing was getting more and more shitty. Now many people say FMAB has a amazing story and its a masterpiece well It might've started off like that but it slowly evolved into a save the world from the big bad villain with a god complex kind of story. Now some parts in the story were very suspenseful and had my full attention. Then some parts of the story were really boring and I found myself zoning out continuously. The story had some really grasping scenes like when Hughes was murdered and when the guy with the blonde hair who loves to smoke(forgot his name lol) was stabbed in the back and was paralyzed for the waist down for the rest of his life and when Roy mustang flipped his shit and roasted Envy alive, those scenes were timed really well and caught me off guard. One thing FMAB did was focus on the drama to much which resulted in a shit ton of over dramatic scenes. Some of the dialogue was cliche and I couldn't stop fucking laughing because they were trying to be serious but I just couldn't take it serious, and I even started predicting some of the events in the story would happen. Anyway the story starts to go down hill and now the elric brothers new objective is to stop the bad guy who wants to obtain the power of god with them finding their bodies being their side quest. Then they have this cliche shounen ending where a seventeen year old kid beats the shit out of god. I mean this is just beyond cliche, the fight was good but i wasn't suprised because in the end i knew he would win. And the fairy tale happily ever after ending was disappointing to.   They never explained the origins of alchemy clearly nor do they explain anything else clearly so I was left with a shit ton of questions but no fucking answers. The story just didn't pull me in and It felt like I was just watching your typical action anime the story wasn't shit it just wasn't a masterpiece like everyone said it was.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Animation / Sound : The Animation was pretty good the character models and the back grounds were well done and so was the animation and art for the alchemy. The fight scenes where pretty neat but nothing too flashy. The voice acting was A1 I thought the sound effects for the fights and explosions were done well to. The intros and ending were just mind blowing sometimes I would just go on YouTube and just watch and listen to the intros. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters: This is the weakest part of the anime.\r\n",
      "Our 2 MCs Edward and Al do not change through out the whole series they remain the same naive little boys they were at the beginning hell the only thing that changed about Edward was his height he became taller as the series continued. Most the characters in FMAB get no development at all and some are just useless as fuck cough...cough... winry, now I don't dislike winry but sometimes she just annoyed the hell out of me and got in the way. The only characters in this show who got good development was Roy Mustang, Envy, crippled cigarette guy(forgot his name), hoenhime (I think I spelled it wrong), and Ling/Greed. Half of the villains on here are evil just for the hell of it and oh yeah the main villain with the god complex is called father he basically created the rest of the villains. Each of them are named after the 7 deadly sins and called homunculus. Apparently each villain represents a fragment of his soul you have\r\n",
      "The homonculus were extremely shallow and were evil to be evil. I mean out of all seven only three shine and those three are Wrath, Greed, Envy. The rest are extremely uninteresting including father. If i had to compare him to a villain it would be Aizen from bleach. \r\n",
      "Now out of all of these villains the most memorable was Envy because of his hatred of humans and his twisted personality he was very exciting to watch and his death was put together really well. Now back to the other characters  Scar was very interesting at first but as the series continued he started to bore the hell out of me until I finally wasn't interested in him any more. Like I said before Roy Mustang got a lot of development he went from the cool and calm guy we know and love to a bloodthirsty animal obsessed over finding out who killed Hughes. Now full metal alchemist brotherhood has some interesting characters but failed to give them any development to the point where I didn't give a fuck if they died.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end by no means was FMAB a bad show no it was a good show that had a lot of potential but it failed to amaze me the unique story was ruined after a couple of episodes. I personally think this anime is overrated as fuck it wasn't bad its just overrated and it just didn't prove to be a masterpiece like everyone claimed it was  , but in the end this is just my opinion . The funny thing is I watched this before  the FMA 2003 version because everyone kept telling FMA 2003 was trash and the funny thing is I ended up liking 2003 more.   Do i recommend this show No you might find your experience different than mine after all we are two completely different people but i don't recommend it bruh. Well I'm done i hoped you enjoyed this review Peace!!!\n",
      "To this day my writing is influenced by Fullmetal Alchemist. I read the manga about ten years ago, but I still remember most of the characters by name. The author's vision and its execution were not without flaws, but the overall end result was sheer brilliance. The themes of loss, sacrifice and transformation are seamlessly integrated into the plot and character backstories.\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There's a good reason why Fullmetal Alchemist has few peers. A story like this is impossible to create unless you've survived fucked up shit, possess the social support and intelligence to make sense of it and have the skills as a storyteller to convey those experiences. The author clearly thinks ill of shortcuts to personal growth (miracle cures, religion, etc.), evidenced by the first episode alone.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seems obvious to point out the inspiration to this series is human darkness - even ethnic genocide makes it into the plot. It's astonishing how deep Fullmetal Alchemist goes with its harrowing concepts, yet rarely feels depressing. The characters talk about their emotions, then keep pushing forward, make new allies and grow as people. To be fair though, they don't actually get many chances to lament their misery, because the intense plot constantly whips them forward.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main mysteries involving the plot are discovered shortly into the series, but the bad guys quickly clean house and cover everything up. This killing creates an incredible tension that sets the pace for the entire rest of the series. Not only that, but on many occasions the episode's cliffhanger is just brutal, reminiscent of Attack on Titan. Friendly advice: DON'T watch this series before bed, make the time to binge it!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cast of characters is varied in genders, ages and body types. Their designs are focused and simplistic, though not without depth. Unlike how females are often drawn in anime, in Fullmetal Alchemist they look nice, but not overtly sexualized. There's also just about no fanservice. Even some of the evil characters are surprisingly humane, which indicates the author's ability for deep empathy. That's a real feat, considering the eyes she has for true darkness.\n",
      "Why do people give this such a high rating!\n",

      "I saw FMAB because of the high rating and amount of praising. I was skeptical to see why it was rated highly. So, I watched it out of curiosity assumed that I would enjoy it because everyone else did. But, It’s so basic in writing that I feel bad for saying that. Also, I feel bad for saying this but FMAB fans just do anything to keep this anime #1 and they only say it’s good because everyone else says it’s good. when others animes with the same aspects of FMAB have way better storylines, characters etc.\n",

Now for what it truly offers and it’s not a memorable experience. Not to say fmab is bad but it wasn’t as great as I expected it to be. After I finished I looked at the score and baffled at why the score was even this high.\n",

They’ve lost their bodies and are in search of the legendary philosopher’s stone to get there bodies back. Now as bad as there poor suffering sounds. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story becomes so predictable because of Edward he is literally a beta male (too kind person) can’t blame Alphonse for following him. Besides he’s the younger brother anyways. They’re too kind to take risks for what they truly want. Since they don’t want anyone to suffer. Really hypocritical for them to continuously say that how they’d do anything to get there bodies back. Then someone sacrificed there life and they were still the same characters throughout the series WHY?? There were so many instances where they’ve could’ve got there bodies back. If i’m correct the brothers had contact with a philosopher’s stone over 5 times. But, Since the philosopher’s stone is made out of basically already dead souls and humans wanting to die the brothers just denied it because they don’t want suffering souls to suffer. That brings me to another point the story changes midway because of there betamale act. They give up on finding or trying to use  the philosophers stone.  They now want to go find another way to get there bodies back so then Alphonse gets memories of being dead and in “the gate truth” this randomly got brought up midway and they want to perform a stupid complicated way to get there bodies back. Also there was lots dumb tropes to keep the MC alive for instance. MC was on the verge of death because he was in a fight and the fucking villains said “Aye I think the kid is badly hurt let’s save him”. What an lazy way to add a trash filler character.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The climax is handled so poorly that it’s like eating rice and bread this one villain reveals himself and the person he revealed himself to (without getting to much into spoilers) was like “Oh yeah so you were the villain?” Then the person goes tells others about the villain they have the most predictable boring reaction. Now a Anime becoming predictable is not a bad thing. But, the way FMAB predictable aspect is handled makes The story becomes bland and uninteresting as shit because tension, suspense, Turning points are poorly handled that it just isn’t at all emotional it’s bland and once you think there is emotional moment it just lands a anticlimactic feeling after that. This just makes the story uninteresting. because there is no connection with how the characters are reacting.\n",

But emotionally wise they ruin it with dumb comedy during dark moments or beautiful ones making it lose suspense while the series is playing and the jokes consist of the MC being short.

      "While FMA brotherhood offers an overall neatly wrapped full experience in anime and is a very easy anime to watch and be entertained by, it seems like many of the series'huge flaws which hurts its overall artistic quality are either being glossed over or are just not being talked about enough. In this review, I'd like to mainly address these issues and hopefully bring forth discussion. Is the anime good? Arguably, yes, it has a lot of great crowd pleasing aspects. Is it perfect and deserving of a 10/10? Sadly, far from it.  If this review sounds in anyway cynical and pessimistic, I apologize,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "for I only think the pages of praise this anime gets needs to be balanced out with a bit of honest criticism. I also felt that I couldn't give an adequate critique without using points in the plot as examples, so I'm sorry in advance for there are some spoilers included. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Firstly, I found that brotherhood was ridden with far too many lazy convenient plot devices and shonen cliches for it to be enjoyable. What do I mean by this concretely? (spoilers ahead) If you look at episode 34 isn't it too much of a coincidence that sloth showed up right when the Elric brothers did in the exact same room? Consider the area sloth has to cover and how many times he actually emerges, isn't it too much of a coincidence that he showed up at Briggs right when the brothers was at the basement? Rather than having a story which melds encounters together naturally and smoothly, we get a cheap device made purely to advance the plot on very questionable grounds. There are other examples as well where we can see characters coincidentally being brought together if you watch the anime again. This is a terrible example of bad story writing and plot advancement. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What about shonen cliches? Just count the number of times in a fight where at the last crucial moment another character shows up to hit the enemy/ally to save someone. I realize that's a really badass shonen cliche, and when used sparingly, it can be somewhat epic, but in this one, it felt too tired and predictable.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The anime is also just far too naive and the actions and consequences of its characters are far too oversimplified. Brotherhood's predecessor might have its weaknesses, but it shines in it's realistic gritty overtones, and character growth in the Elrics as they journey through a bittersweet coming of age tale. In Brotherhood, there is only the illusion of character growth as they all have their respective emotional private dialogues, but these don't wallow past melodrama and towards episode 60, the elrics, mainly ed, are still the self righteous naive kids as they were when they started their journey. They don't murder under any circumstance for one but that morality is never explored because that's too much thinking and moral ambiguity confuses the audience I guess. In the original FMA, Ed had to resort to murder because of the situation and as dark as it was, the maturity was visible and there was a lot to be taken from that experience. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Often times moral themes in this anime don't get explored beyond \"X is wrong so don't do it!\" just like that annoying scene towards the end (spoiler)where everyone tells Mustang he'll become a different person if he takes his satisfying revenge on the homunculus who's committed multiple unforgivable crimes against humanity, but never goes into depth about the nature of revenge or why Roy will become evil if he takes vengeance in this instance. The nature of Roy's revenge wasn't even an explored theme until this moment, and all of a sudden everyone gets on envy's side and turns their teeth on Roy for no other reason but to tell kids on the other side that acts like this is bad because it turns you into a fiend for some reason. Was I not the only one shouting for them to end envy's life already? This was after the blunder of them not ending one of the world's most dangerous beings before by \"putting him in a jar and giving it to a girl to be taken on a far journey\" without assessing all the risks properly. The homunculi were dehumanized in contrast to the original FMA and made completely unsympathetic (save wrath and old greed) , and we are suppose to sympathize for them at the end for some reason when they were made to barely unlikable? It seems like everyone protects envy throughout the plot. There is \"explaining morality through well written actions and subtext\" and there is \"preachy\" Brotherhood is definitely on the side of preachy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mustang as well as everyone else's involvement in the Ishballan war was also not exposed enough I felt. There was not enough psychological explorations on that dark. evil event in history. In the original, there were enough time dedicated to show us the gravity of what happens during war, specifically the massacre of innocents and the guilt state alchemists have to bear, but all that was glossed over in brotherhood, and I felt the weight of war in general was not conveyed well at all when the anime had multiple opportunities to do so. (not just the ishballan war, but the civil battle at the end as well) and instead, we get shallow melodrama, plenty of light comedic relief, and not much food for the mind for us to ponder on. It feels like at times, the anime is almost afraid to be depressing. Compare Hughe's death sequence in both versions and tell me the one in brotherhood has more of an emotional impact. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Speaking of comedic relief, the chibi comedy moments in this anime really ruined a lot of potential serious moments. Often times, there was too much light relieving, there was nothing left to relieve but we get comedic relief'ed anyways. The atmospheric tones was much too inconsistent at key times where the director doesn't grip you in any major emotion for a significant amount of time.  For an anime which uses so much comedy, FMAB suffers from the curse of just not being funny. I get it, Edward doesn't like to be called short, ok, I had a chuckle the first couple of times it was mentioned, but for the gag to be in almost every other episode was just straight overkill. I found laughter more in the subtler gags such as ed's terrible design sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another naive and convenient moment was when all of kimblee's men happened to be good guys. They needed someone to rescue ed and be dependable, so hey, the two chimeras who were just trying to kill him a minute ago turns out to be genuinely good people because we'd have a dead main character otherwise. They couldn't kill the two chimeras in the room with scar who were tied up because the anime isn't dark enough to do that, so hey, Al trusted them at their word and they happened to be good people incapable of betrayal because everyone has good in their heart and just need to be trusted and the world is a great and simple place just like that! and just like that two allies were added to the roster out of nowhere because Arakawa couldn't write herself out of that predicament any other way.. changes of hearts are not gradual and realistic, but are rather handed out like Jesus pamphlets. Scar didn't have a second thought when the elders in his tribe whom he trusts questioned his actions, but switches sides just like that when he meets an ishballan soldier for the first time? I'm just suppose to buy that and go along? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The author also ignores too many possibilities regarding the use of alchemy while writing this. In an anime about alchemy, you'd think it'd be used more. When Al and Marco's car got a flat tire at the end, where was alchemy? when ed and gang was fighting hoards of zombie homunculi, where was the alchemy to simply bind them to the ground or wall? when the gold toothed doctor was taking his sweet time to draw a transmutation circle, where was the simple attempt to clap the ground to disrupt it? These were all techniques shown to be utilized in earlier episodes but not used so the plot could unravel at a contrived pace which makes questionable sense. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What the anime excels in is the fluidity of fight scenes, and the masterful animation with fine attention to detail all throughout, to the point where we can see the scar on Roy's hand healing scene by scene, episode by episode. I found characters in general to be paper thin and ill characterized because the episodes were more plot concentrated (but then again so was geass, but it dedicated enough time to character exposition at the same time) .I really wanted to like brotherhood...but really walked out feeling I just watched an above mediocre shonen which doesn't break the chains of its genre down to the last cheesy, sappy line uttered by its protagonist at the end.\n",

      "FMA: Brotherhood more closely follows the story line of the original manga, rather than the original television series which featured an original story line. Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their mother Trisha in the remote village of Risembool. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys were still young, and while in Trisha's care they began to show an affinity for alchemy. However, when Trisha died of\n",

Upon returning home, the two decide to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy. However, human transmutation is a taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly. In the failed transmutation that results, Al's body is completely obliterated and Ed loses his left leg. In a last ditch attempt to keep his brother alive, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bring Al's soul back and houses it in a nearby suit of armor. After Edward receives automail prosthetics from Winry and Pinako, the brothers decide to burn their childhood home down (symbolizing their determination and decision of \"no turning back\") and head to the capital city to become government sanctioned State Alchemists. After passing the exam, Edward is dubbed the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" by the State Military, and the brothers begin their quest to discover the nature of the fabled Philosopher's Stone, under the direction of Colonel Roy Mustang. Along the way, they discover a deep government conspiracy to hide the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone that involves the homonculi, the alkahestrists of the neighboring nation of Xing, the scarred man from the war-torn nation of Ishbal, and their own father's past.\n",

      "Okay, so this is only my third review at this point, meaning that my reviewing pants are still a little tight and don't cup the goods just right yet, but I'm a firm advocate of sink or swim and, this being a review of one of the most popular [and currently highest rated] shows on MAL, I figure that I'll either be met with wild success or consigned to the murky depths of obscurity.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Right, so I'd like to go into this saying that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining beacon of hope amongst the fetid mire of what counts for shounen today. My own personal\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "biases aside, I have never seen an anime that so completely earned its rating of 10 by being so consistently competent in just about every category. The merits of its predecessor, Fullmetal Alchemist, may be widely disputed, but there is no doubt that Brotherhood is one of the best anime that I've had the pleasure of watching and arguably the most well rounded shounen out there. Now, being the pleb that I am, I've never actually read the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, and therefore cannot attest to how closely the show follows it, but those of you who watched the original will find that, up to a certain point, it treads pretty much the same ground as its predecessor; beyond that point, the two stories diverge wildly with the introduction of the neighboring country of Xing [China, basically] and the squinty-eyed badasses that hail from it. On an off note, I always thought it odd that, in most anime, the Japanese characters look for all the world like young white teenagers, but when you introduce a Chinese guy, it's all \"harrows\" and squinty-eyes from there.  At any rate, the Xingese characters really put the militaristic regime of Amestris [the setting of most of the story] into perspective, but I'll get to them later.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story itself is excellently paced, chronicling the Elric Brothers' journey to get their bodies back and their subsequent discoveries about the nature of alchemy itself. This sets the perfect premise for an exciting story that explores the consequences of human transmutation and the myriad of other complex moral issues presented by something such as alchemy. It also [frequently] touches on the physical and emotional repercussions of war, and the use of alchemists as a military asset, but my favorite part of the story is perhaps that it finally elucidates on Houenheim, the boys' father, who was an enigmatic figure throughout the entirety of the original, and his curious relation to the show's behind-the-scenes antagonist [of whom, by the way, is far more interesting than the original's]. I would elaborate more on the story itself, but I'll abstain from it for fear of spoiling any plot twists or revelations, of which there are many. The only real complaints that I have are that FMA:B suffered once or twice from your typical stilted anime dialogue and odd anime morality. This isn't to say that the characters weren't all consistent and believable in their decision making, they really were,  but there was one point where a character, in an incredibly justified fit of rage, was about to kill someone who clearly deserved to die [that he'd been looking for throughout the whole show in fact], but was stopped. Why? Because afterwards he \"wouldn't be the same.\" I imagine not; he'd probably have quite a load off his chest and walk with a little more skip in his step in my opinion, but everyone else may as well have been quoting Star Wars, what with their \"if you strike him down in anger, then you’ll give in to it yourself,” as though avenging countless lives is paramount to joining the Dark Side. I'd say that scene was absolutely confusing, but it actually contributed to an interesting bit of characterization for one of the bad guys; and besides, only a Sith deals in absolutes. \r\n",
      "Another [in fact, the only other] gripe that I had was with how they treated the beginning, which, as I mentioned before, is roughly the same as the original's [which was quite dark], except for some reason they thought it’d be a good idea to throw more Cartoon Faces in there. I mean, I understand throwing in a little humor for the sake of levity when things are getting too grim, but when a girl is contemplating murder after being coerced with promises of reuniting with her deceased boyfriend, having her aim at the wrong person just to throw in another \"haha, Ed is short\" joke doesn't quite cut it. Not to mention that one of the times Al went into \"cartoon\" mode during a funny scene it struck me that he looked an awful lot like a big grey condom, a thought which I just couldn't shake off for the rest of the show. Aside from that, the story is pretty much flawless.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Interestingly enough, while Ed and Al are obviously the main duo, what with them being featured prominently on the box art, they can't really be said to be the only main characters. Brotherhood also follows a fairly sizable cast of interesting characters, showing no particular favor to any one of them, instead opting to diligently flesh out each and every one of their individual journeys; including among them an ambitious military officer's campaign to root out dangerous enemies on the inside and rise among the ranks of his fellow soldiers to the esteemed title of Fuhrer [which I understand sounds suspicious to anyone post 1945, but despite obvious comparisons, Amestris isn't Nazi Germany], to the survivor of a domestic genocide [okay... maybe it is] and his quest for vengeance, with a whole array of compelling characters in between. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I'm on the topic of characters: if you were to ask me which of those  were my favorite, I'd be a genuine loss; every one of them is consistent and interesting, and they compose what is certainly one of my favorite casts in anime or media in general. I must, however, award special merit to a few: King Bradley, for perfectly encapsulating all that is man; fearless, pertinacious, and unrepentant. Riza Hawkeye and Roy Mustang, for being the most well-rounded female character and the most relatable badass respectively. Houenheim, for having a beard worthy of Rider himself, and...\r\n",
      "Actually, you know what? Never mind, all of them were amazing. Not to mention that FMA:B sports the biggest cast of female badasses that I've seen since Black Lagoon. A few characters are necessary to mention however, such as the new Xingese characters, Ling Yao [and his guards Lan Fan and Fuu], and Shao May [possibly one of the most refreshingly competent kids I've seen in anime], who are introduced around the time that Brotherhood starts coming into its own, and add a lot of supplementary lore about the world surrounding Amestris; also the Homunculi, because I really enjoyed how most of their deaths seemed to be accompanied by some underlying theme that corresponded to their respective traits. While there is so much to love, the thing that I find most impressive about the characters is that seemingly all of them are relevant. Honestly. I can't tell you how many characters were introduced that I immediately pegged as throwaways, but come the end of the show there they are, doing things. Important things. No single character can be considered the product of bad writing and they all experience growth and development in their respective arcs, oftentimes as a result of their novel interactions with the rest of the cast. By the way, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the battles, this being a shounen and all. The animation is top notch for the fights this time around and you can tell that the development team went all out on each and every one; this show sports some of the most well animated fighting that I've seen. Not to mention that the action is pretty clever, and revolves around the use of tactics as opposed to power levels, meaning that the winner of any one confrontation was entirely circumstantial and therefore appropriately suspenseful. Every encounter is fast paced and exhilarating, and thankfully so, because there are plenty of them.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly, the music and voice acting are superb. I personally watched Brotherhood dubbed, and would highly recommend it myself, because how often do you get to enjoy a genuinely outstanding dub? I tried the sub as well and found the voice acting similarly inspired; I really only chose the dub for the sheer novelty of actually getting to listen to a competent English cast. Each voice actor did an amazing job and matched their character perfectly. Ed and Al were voiced splendidly, easily conveying an entire range of emotions, Bradley was a warm family man and a menacing leader in the same breath, you could hear Roy's pain at his past molded into fuel for his ambition for the future, and of course, I could listen to Alex Louis Armstrong FOR GENERATIONS! The music was likewise impressive; this was actually one of few anime where I listened to every single opening song, every time. The OST as a whole was grand and, though some were perhaps initially overused, I never once found the BGM to be jarring or unfitting to the scene. Brotherhood also knows when to use silence; a valuable skill that many shows haven't quite gotten the hang of. Absolutely no qualms in the audio department.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All in all, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant pool of trite shounen anime; the story is captivating, the fights are thrilling, and the characterization is exemplary. Sure it may have its flaws, like that stupid “no confirmation of [romantic] feelings [to each other] until the very end” thing that anime does, but that’s a minor thing when compared to the tour de force of competency that is Brotherhood. There’s a reason that it’s resting comfortably at #1 after all.\n",
      "I, personally, love everything about Fullmetal, for not only is it an amazing anime, full of an incredible amount of heart and soul,  but it was also the first anime that really introduced me to the beautiful world of manga, anime and Japanese culture. Whilst not being the first anime i ever watched, (dragon ball z being the first, followed by Nartuo (which i personally never really liked), it was the first anime that i completed fully. So, to my surprise, in 2010, after about a 3 year break from anime, when i came across the title Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, i was surprised that\n",

      "the story wasn't over yet, (i never had access to the internet until the age of 13, this being in 2010, and the library where i got my manga didn't have the complete volumes of Fullmetal), yet i decided to ignore it, only until recently i decided to watch it, due to my passion for anime coming back in 2013, and i gotta say, every moment, every minute was absolutely astonishing and to this day Fullmetal Alchemist will always have a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite anime. :3\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: The story of FMA:B is basically the tale of 2 brothers, Ed and Al, who after performing a forbidding type of Alchemy called  Human Transportation to bring their dead mother back to life end-up not only failing to bring their mother back to life but also sacrificing their bodies, Ed losing his arm and leg, whilst his brother AL is locked to a suit of armor. The story of Fullmetal Alchemist is rich, full of brilliant themes and ideas that at times can be absolute tear-jerkers, to dark undertones, such as genocide, corruption, lust, greed, envy and wrath. The whole story is essentially a journey to reclaim what has been lost and a chance at redemption (for example ED AND AL trying to re-gain their lost limbs). Everything about the plot to full-metal is almost flawless, the ending is absolutely spectacular leaving absolutely no plot holes. \n",

      "Sound: The music in Fullmetal is absolutely brilliant, especially the opening and closing songs. All music does a fantastic job at showing the themes and the underlining feel of the show, a chance of redemption and to find what has been lost. Over the Dub and the Sub, for fullmetal, i would have to go with the DUB, every performance is top-notch, not one bad bit of dialog, yet you can never go wrong for the 2, sub and dub, both are top-notch. \n",

      "Before I go into this review, I'm just going to say that I actually like FMAB. It is a good anime, and definitely a must watch. That said, there are just a few things about it that just rub me the wrong way.\r\n",
      "   First of all, the story. It starts out dark, atmospheric, and complicated, just like the first anime, but unfortunately the story loses most of that atmosphere about a quarter of its way into the story, where as FMA was able to maintain that feeling of brooding tension from beginning to end. The pacing is terrible as well,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "and the reason of this is also the main reason as to why the story loses its feel: the first act.  Arkawa wrote the manga in a fairly clean three part story;\r\n",
      "-the first act (which concludes with Greed's spoiler)\r\n",
      "-the second act (Briggs)\r\n",
      "-the third act (Promise Day)\r\n",
      "The problem with the first act isn't in its composition, indeed, in terms of composition I'd say that that the first act is the best of the three. Its all in the manner in which the story is told. The entire first act is blasted through in about 15 episodes, followed by a choppy, confusing transition into the second part. The rest of the story suffers as a result, as the second act is entirely plot driven with little space for development with the main characters, which in turn leads to the feeling that you're not actually watching a story as much as you are just watching people you don't care about do things for hours on end. The third act is admittedly outstanding, but there is still a slight feeling of indifference radiated by several characters and certain events take an absurd amount of time to come to pass. There is a reason for this pacing problem, that problem being that the show seemingly expects people to have watched the first series and tries not to bore them with the first act. Which is completely and utterly idiotic given the unbreakable golden rule of adaptations: never assume that the audience has seen the original or read the book. The ending is a mixed bag as well. Its undeniably satisfying, but it is also far too simple and happy for such a complex series.\r\n",
      "   The cast of Brotherhood is a mixed bag, some characters (Ed, Alphonse, Scar, Izumi, Major Armstrong) are solid, but not as good they were in the original. Others (pretty much just Mustang and Winry) are better than they were in the original due to a higher level of focus and more interesting subplots. A few characters, unfortunately, are either boring archetypes or just plain useless. May Chang and Yoki have practically no purpose in the story other than to be love interests or comedy relief. There is no depth to their characters and no real purpose (May Chang does introduce a new kind of Alchemy to the main characters, but that could have also been done just as easily by Ling giving Ed a book or something), so when they get in danger or die, the audience has no reason to give a damn other than \"Well, I thought she was kind of cute.\".  The worst character, however, is easily Olivier Mira Armstrong, and believe me (or hate me, which is probable) when I say that this character is the literal epitome of almost everything wrong with modern media. So many people these days fall in love with characters just because they subvert gender/racial stereotypes, which isn't even remotely close to being a reason to like a character (unless if you in turn are racist or sexist). Olivier Mira Armstrong isn't well rounded, has no character development other than a cliche growing of fondness towards her \"weak\" brother, and does absolutely nothing other than order others around and act like a badass (and by badass I mean backstabbing old guys and getting her ass handed to her by the dumbest character in the series). We never see Olivier laugh, cry, get scared, or do anything other. Good character my ass. As for the villains, there is some good and some bad. Pride and Kimblee are awesome, though I still prefer the orginal Kimblee. Envy is a decent one as far as generic psychopaths are concerned, and the Azula moment that he pulls against Mustang towards the end is spectacularly handled. Wrath on the other hand is a badass but forgettable, and his moment of goodness in the end felt horribly contrived. The big bad lead villain works, but is basically a less subtle Voldemort with a vendetta against God. Once again, badass, but forgettable.\r\n",
      "  As far as art goes, FMAB is okay. Some things look a bit too round (Mustang literally looks like a five year old) and Edward's hair takes even longer to get used to. The action, animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all brilliant and help ease you through the story where the pacing and the tension fails.\r\n",
      "  Overall, Brotherhood is a pretty good series, as long as you don't think too much about the ending or tha pacing or the characters. Just enjoy the ride and don't expect the masterpiece that the MAL community might pressure you into believing it is.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist, a story about 2 brothers going on a journey in a magical fantasy world, which brings us as the audience closer to the interesting idea of equal trade. “Giving something in order to get something” A very realistic idea but in this universe much more effective. To make a material out of another, a dream of the ancient alchemist to create gold and probably an idea that will occur to us in a distant unknown future. Fullmetal Alechemist is an anime I only can look kindly upon. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "7 years after the original anime fascinated many of viewer studio “Bones” decided to make Fullmetal\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Alchemist again, with slightly better graphics and more accurately to the manga and it seems like that Brotherhood is even better than the original, at least the majority of people on this website think so. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think it is quite understandable why the Brotherhood series is more popular and more liked than the original, at least on this website. It is also my biggest problem about it. On the one hand Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood had more action scenes and on the other it had a more complex but better explained storyline. That seems quite good doesn’t it? Well the problem is Brotherhood explains every detail of the story, as if the storywriters think the audience can’t think for themselves. The character constantly reminds you of several things so you absolutely can’t forget them. Half way through an episode it also has to remind you of the anime you are currently watching, with shouting its name out loud, just to make sure. This penetrating need to explain everything goes way beyond normal story explanations. Even though in some cases explaining the story by SHOWING you the story is more enjoyable in many cases it need to be TOLD, especially in anime that are character based and have a lot of conversations involved. Sometimes a story gives you the clue “A” and the clue “B” and you have to come to the conclusion “C”, sometimes it gives you a clue “A” and the conclusion “C” and you can, if you want come to the result “B”.  “Brotherhoods” doesn’t do that, it gives you everything and the character just screams the conclusion out as if they can’t wait until you know their secret plan. I mean what is the secret behind something you tell everyone? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "It just bothers me when villain out of no reason start telling you their whole plan, or what evil stuff they already did, especially when they don’t need to. Why would they do that? And when they tell you everything about their plan why do they stop there? Why not telling the audience WHY they did that, WHAT motivations they had? Maybe going a little bit into the depth of characters? Sadly we dont get any of that in this anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But let’s go to the analysis: \r\n",
      "The story had a more immature writing style. It’s not only the already mentioned dragging you in only one direction and don’t allow any open mind believe that make this anime immature there are more than just that point. The representation for example was very childish. You can’t take a show seriously that constantly includes comedy parts, with a funny artstyle, which doesn’t even spare villains. From the story part, compared to the original there isn’t any uniqueness anymore. The anime really tries to be in the shounen genre since it lacks of consequences, motivations and logic in many cases. Even though this anime explains everything there are still many open question to it, which are very important once, maybe even plotholes or contradictions and not some simple questions like in the original, which are a matter of your own creativity.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pacing for the show changes a bit. First it starts of very fast, as if it wants to go through the story that the original had as fast as possible, and then it comes to a normal pacing. Besides the fast start the pacing was quite enjoyable. The start was a pretty important and emotional part in the original. But Brotherhoods because of the rushed pacing doesn’t manage to create the same effect as the original at the start. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like I said before the animes main thematic is equal trade. It was everywhere in the original.  So many little details were made, from the beginning to the ending to bring this realistic idea which was presented in a fictive style closer to its viewers. The “Brotherhoods”-series lacks so many of these points. At the start you can see it, but the more the story progresses the more it goes lost until it’s completely forgotten in the end. It is unbelievable that the writer of the manga doesn’t even get the point of his own manga, why else would he make such a consequence free story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The anime is also very popular because of its action scenes. But they are way too uncreative. Think about it, in this world they could make every material out of everything (at least they make steal out of stone, so silicon into iron + carbon(you also have to consider the high temperatures that have to be created), which is already hell of a transformation) It is idiotic to fight just with your “sword” when you have such an ability. You could create a vacuum or make the bottom liquid and then trap them. There are sure even far more greater ideas than that. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood not only wants to be shounen it also tries as hard as it can to be accepted for mature audience as well. The unfitting and forced inclusion of dark gore themes and making some appearances especially bloody, but sadly they didn’t manage to do that in terms of characters and basic of story. It’s a childish story wrapped up with mature themes, explained to the audience as if they were kids. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "A very big shounen inclusion and a very annoying story-part is the love story they written into it. In the original the fact that the blond mechanic chick is so unimportant to Ed is a very nice thing. It’s a story about 2 brothers going on a journey not a typical love story. Therefore the inclusion of such a thing only makes it feel like the storywriters tried as hard as they could to make it appealing to as many viewers as they can. And dont get me even started on how bad the consequence free, deus ex machina ending was... but it was pretty fitting for a  shounen anime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character are written more to appeal to a younger audience as well. You can clearly see that. Ed and Alfonse act only a little bit differently than in the original but its significant change made there. In the original they had childish attitude and believes, but unlike in shounen anime the show doesn’t give them the opportunity to change the world. The thing that bothers me about shounen anime is the fact that the storywriters take a childish main protagonist who thinks that he alone could change the world and the storywriters give him the ability to do that. The drama in such shounen anime is reduced to pathetic written melodrama and the invention of motivations hasn’t been done in any kind of way. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But let’s go back to the protagonist and his brother. The thing is, in the original they followed a goal which they wanted to accomplish with everything they did. The grow over the duration of the show and get more mature. In brotherhood they rather help everyone out, what makes them common “hero-typed, being nice to everyone, expect for the bad guys”- characters. They never grow and never learn anything or change their behaviour.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the other characters in Brotherhood are either annoying or unfocused or badly written. You have for example arrogant, very little knowing characters as the “good” guys, whom the storywriters use to explain the plot to the audience and we got emotionless, unmotivated and idiotic enemies who have not the slightest abilities to come up with a working plan and therefore aren’t able to create any threat to the audience.\r\n",
      "Just look at Van Hohenheim. In the original a serious guy with a goal, for which he even could make sacrifices to achieve it. And a caring father for his children, while keeping his distance. He has his secrets which makes him interesting. In Brotherhood: A typical whiny guy, who cant see anyone dying and who wants to save everyone, without goal and with a past that is completely idiotic.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also have to mention the homunculi, which are a very important group of character. For those who doesn’t know the original: The homunculi are the anti-heroes or the enemies if you like. The original gave them background story and motivations. Normally I don’t think it is important for an action based anime to go into the depth of characters especially villains, but besides the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist has a lot of character conversations it’s also every time a nice thing to do. In this case it feels also very special, since the homunculi represent the 7 deadly sins. Everyone acts like the deadly sin he represented which makes everything quite accurate and detailed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The homunculi are now in brotherhoods not only rather unimportant but completely forgotten in terms of personifications, depth, motivations and everything else that made them likeable in the original. They have no background story or any kind of focus. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The homunculi don’t act like the deadly sin they represented anymore. Envy acts arrogant all the time only saying he is envy, but there is no explanation why. Greed also has to tell the audience that he is greedy else you wouldn’t know. The characters have to tell you what they are, they can’t SHOW you.  The whole story has to be told to you to explain it and can’t be shown to you. And Wrath said something like: I’m proud of being a homunculus. Sloth is the worst of all because he is working overtime. In fact Brotherhood doesnt have any vilains that are interesting, or that could create any sort of threads. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Artstlye and soundtrack of \"Brotherhood\" were very good.The animations looked clean and the backgrounds and characterdesign was very well and detailed drawn. \r\n",
      "Soundtrack was better in the original but \"Brotherhood\" had a lot of nice tracks as well. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion Fullmetal Brotherhood was an enjoyable anime and maybe it would have been even a decent one, if there wasn’t already an anime that is the same thing, only superior in every important aspect. Brotherhood only shines in the shounen aspect with illogical inclusion, annoying overused character, lack of motivation or any kind of uniqueness and plotholes unable to count.\n",
      "Have you ever gotten that feeling of overwhelming sadness once you finish an anime/manga because you know there will never be another one like it in its genre? That was the feeling I got when I finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the controversy of the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime deviating greatly from the manga, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created as a completely faithful adaptation of the manga. Despite being a shounen series, Brotherhood adopts a unique, more mature approach to action shounen anime while still retaining the basic qualities of the genre.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The series takes place in a small, but powerful country called Amestris that mirrors Nazi\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Germany. Amestris is a militaristic totalitarian country in which its most powerful figure (well, sorta) is the head of the military, addressed as Führer. There are many other historical references, including imperialistic desires, trench warfare, and an event similar to the Holocaust, and they help us to understand the situation Amestris is in at the start of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story follows the journey of teenage alchemists Edward and Alphonse Elric, brothers determined to get back their original bodies after a deadly accident following a failed Human Transmutation. As they try to find the legendary Philosopher’s Stone, an all-powerful item that can purportedly return them to their bodies, it becomes apparent that this mysterious object is tied in to every single conflict Amestris has been in. Unlike other shounens’ plots, which are tailored to maximize fighting, FMA’s plot is intriguing and full of genuine suspense. At its core though, the series is an endearing story about the resilient bond between two brothers who’ll never give up until they achieve their goal, despite seemingly impossible odds and obstructing obstacles.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the series, alchemy is a blend of supernaturalism and chemistry that essentially takes an object and changes or transmutes it into a different object. A highly practical ability, alchemy can be used for medical purposes, fighting, building, etc. As an aspiring science major, this is one part of the series that really impressed me. For instance, there is a scene where Ed is forced to fight a character that can shield his body with diamond, one of the hardest substances on earth. After realizing the makeup of the shield, Ed transmutes the diamond into graphite (both are allotropes of carbon), a much more brittle substance. All the carbon atoms were still present, but now they were rearranged to weaken the shield. The incorporation of chemistry gives the fights so many possibilities. The Law of Conservation of Mass is somewhat applied to alchemy in the concept called Equivalent Exchange. Whatever the amount you use is the amount you receive. Of course, one of the powers of the Philosopher’s Stone is the ability to defy this rule of Equivalent Exchange, a reason why it is so coveted.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Much of the fighting in this series is relegated to close combat (until the final battle). Usually, the combatants are armed with some type of weapon, or if they’re alchemists, they can also transmute projectiles. But sometimes, the fights are as simple as hand to hand combat. Few people have truly unique abilities, especially since most fighting alchemists have similar abilities and the normal people can’t use any supernatural abilities anyway, so you won’t see crazy destructive powers like those of Naruto or Bleach. However, don’t misconstrue the fights to be any less exciting. The action is just as exhilarating, and with the inclusion of alchemy, we often see incredible environmental manipulation. Strategy is important, so the alchemic principle of understanding is sometimes crucial in fights. However, as a shounen that is more plot-driven than most, some of the fights are rather one-sided. After all, fights are supposed to be decided quickly, not take up several episodes and waste our times. Many of the fights serve to advance the plot, so more than anything, we see character development and learn more about the events preceding the series during these fights.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are easily the best part of the series. There are many of them, and they all serve specific roles in the series. The most important ones are given fleshed-out backstories, and through these, we learn about their unique personalities, values, and internal conflicts, as well as get a sense of what exactly happened to lead up to the actual events of the series. Each character has some sort of goal that they hope to achieve, be it a return to a previous life, revenge, becoming the next Führer, or achieving immortality. The main antagonists of the series are the Homunculus, an immortal group of near-invincible creatures with human exteriors. There are seven of them, each one representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and much of their personalities and goals are based upon their respective sins. Their mysterious “Father” is the one who created them. These characters are far from one-dimensional. Their psychological conflicts and emotional backgrounds really help you empathize with them. In fact, Fullmetal Alchemist has spawned a number of my favorite characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, despite all the praise I’ve given to Brotherhood, it does have a few setbacks, although whether these can be called setbacks depends on the viewer. The show often likes to resort to light-hearted slapstick comedy typical of a shounen series. Accompanying this is the occasional use of the chibi style of art. Some people may find this aggravating, although I personally have no problem with it. Also, the pacing of the series is somewhat inconsistent. Initially, the series moves rather quickly, resolving conflicts in only one or two episodes. At times, this gave the series an episodic feel. However, the pacing becomes much more streamlined towards the middle. Towards the latter part of the series, the pacing slows down considerably, and the final arc pretty much occurs within the span of a few hours. Again though, I found no problem with this personally, and the way the show was paced at different parts worked well with the occurrences in the plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The music is very suitable for the atmosphere of the show, giving an eerie, serious, ethereal, heartwarming, tragic, or lively feel depending on the scene. It’s not exactly memorable though, but it works. All the OPs and EDs are fairly good as well. On the other hand, the voice acting is perfect for the characters, especially Ed’s voice. Emotions are flawlessly conveyed through the voice actors. The animation is also fantastic. The fight scenes are exciting and flow well. No choppy movements. Occasionally, the faces do look somewhat disfigured and disproportionate (often times Mustang’s), but other than that, the artwork is detailed and generally solid.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience. Its world is so intricate, but gradually, everything is explained in full detail, and it truly is beautifully crafted.  This isn’t just another shounen anime. Its incorporation of political, religious, psychological, and philosophical elements and its focus on plot over fighting definitely make it a much more mature series than your typical shounen. At the same time, its slapstick comedy and grand fights are the reason for its shounen tag, but that’s not a bad thing. Also, this is the only action series that has invoked any serious emotion in me, showing that I actually cared about these characters. It is unfortunate to see it end, but all good things must eventually come to an end. This is a shounen that’s done right.\n",
      "I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good to watch. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric and Roy Mustang & the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it is not as impressive as the first half.\r\n",
      "Anywayz, Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy. \r\n",
      "And I will finish by saying that if you are going to watch one anime in the entirety of your life time, Choose FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood\n",
      "People tell me that I am too old for Japanese cartoons (those people are specifically idiots that prefer to say cartoons rather than anime). Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood aired 5 years ago so it classifies as an old anime but get this, I am never going to be too old and too late to watch FMA: B. \n",

      "to it. After all, this show is by far the most epic thing I have ever seen in my entire life and I’m not just saying that because I am a fandom of it. The moment I first watched it, I was completely addicted and it became my instant favorite. (You may want to skip the third paragraph because I went through a long way before watching FMA: B but if you are interested on the story, fine with me.)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Okay, this anime was never my decision to watch and it comes with a whole journey of doubt. Last 2010, I was amazed after seeing Soul Eater and I became a huge fan of it. I used to go to this website called animecrazy.net (You guys may never heard of this website but it was removed some year ago or years ago) and it has this section called “Most Popular Anime of all time” and every time I view it I see Soul Eater at number 9 which makes me happy; however, as months pass, it goes to spot #13 and I was completely mad and to think the anime that beat Soul Eater was Fairy Tail and Full Metal Alchemist/Brotherhood. I had a huge grudge on those two shows so I promised that I will never betray Soul Eater (hardcore fan girl right?) but that assurance was broken until now. I watched shows that were really crappy before seeing Full Metal. For example, 12 anime shows that completely tell nothing but friendship and getting a boyfriend and some shows with potential but with plot holes and open endings. I never really felt so bored. Not even a single anime left me with an incredible impression for the reason that most of them never gave me a superb feeling like what SE handed me years ago. Until one day, I was watching Baccano! And saw a recommendation about Full Metal so I did it and broke my pledge. I deceived SE but I never thought that it was going to be my best decision EVER!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Full Metal Alchemist has a great story because each arc has a connection with one another. The first arc is the goal of getting Al and Ed their bodies back. The second arc is the villain’s plan which I will not tell you because I am not going to be a spoiler. The third arc is a clan’s mission in finding immortality in order to save their culture. The fourth arc is the anti-hero’s plan of seeking revenge on the military. If you think that’s all, think again. There are more back stories, more characters to invade, more unexpected happenings and more development on every character’s relationship. What makes it unique is that it uses Alchemy which is an ancient part of Chemistry (which is being taught to students of our era). Alchemy for some people claims to be magic of some sort but believe it or not it helped produced Chemistry that we know of today. This show is mainly talking about alchemy and it made it look so damn good. Some people will think that it’s going to be a boring show because it talks about a philosophical science but it is more than that. There will be a unexplainably awesome adventure for you guys with comedy, drama (lots of it), action, and surprisingly, a little subtle romance. I give the plot an outstanding 10 because face it, Arakawa-sensei made a story like no other. It is unique, incomparable and marvelous in a million levels. Sure, people will think that I am exaggerating a bit and yes there are flaws in this anime like there are some cliché ticks; nevertheless, it is quite different because there are no fillers and Brotherhood is straight to the point, a little fast paced and of course, the episode that capped everything is undoubtedly superior and satisfactorily complied with my expectations and even surpassed it. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aniplex and Funimation had become popular in every anime show. Both organizations never fails to amaze me with their techniques when it comes to graphics but I won’t lie, the art is just very good and it did its best for a 2009 show by depicting very iconic styles and motifs. The background can be a little simple like its lacking details and animation. The colors were just nicely done. They know when to make a vibrant scene and a when to put a shadowy effect. Everything was just balanced and pleasing. People may observe it as mediocre but it did a splendid job for the graphics. Considering how it has a more modern impact unlike the original 2003 FMA, it also has great animation schemes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the best points in FMA: B is their OST or original soundtrack. Every anime that has Bones as their producer really has excellent music that you won’t absolutely ignore (take OHSHC, CB and SE for example). For the opening songs, my biggest recommendation and the song that I really liked is Yui’s Again. It has a rather lavishing drama and courage mixed into it. It has a dramatic entry at first but it has a catchy tone in the latter part of it. The third opening, Golden Time Lover is also convincing and fun to listen to because it has rock music and it is also upbeat and likable. The fourth opening is great too, Period by Chemistry has a slow and not too quick rhythm but it uses electric guitar as its main tune. The second opening is full hope and has more happiness into it. Rain is just too all over the place but the video that comes along with the song helps. It is good but it just wasn’t notable for me. The endings were just as grand as the OPs. The best among the rest is Miho Fukuhara’s Let it Out (which is better than Frozen’s Let it Go) because it is the song that never gets out of my head. It is very iconic and very dramatic. It made me cry so hard every time it plays with a very sad moment in FMA: B. I loved it so much and is willing to make it as my favorite Otaku song. Uso, Shunkan Sentimental, and Ray of Light were all good and aspiring to hear. The blend of RnB and Alternative Rock was splendid (am I right). For Tsunaida Te, I disliked it because of the rap that goes along with the piano it didn’t blend with the slow and steady melody. For the sound effects, some were quite repetitive but hey, that’s what makes it iconic and memorable. When it plays somewhere you’ll know that it is Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood’s soundtrack. The voice actors were flawless. They placed all the great emotions at the right time and the right place. Whether they need to be funny, sad, and emotionally fine they did it at the greatest quality as possible. Although, I am not fond of the English dub in many anime shows, FMA: B’s English dub was distinct. The Japanese dub is great too but the English dub was more hilarious. I was just a little concerned with Ed’s voice in the Japanese dub because Paku Romi is good at Edward’s younger voice but when Ed became a little older, she should’ve made her voice a little deeper but no sweat, she is a girl after all. In the English dub Vic Minogna’s voice was flexible at all costs. Kugimiya Rie and the English dub actors of Alphonse did an exceptional job (they were too many I can’t distinguish who was who). The others were awesome too making this anime lively and entertaining. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters are also one of the strongest potential of Brotherhood. Of course, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric were a great main character duo. Both were entertaining and somehow have various personalities. Individually, they are different but both are awesome protagonists. The supporting casts were explicit from Roy Mustang to the villains. I didn’t hate any character in this anime. Each and every one of them was lovable and funny. Yeah, so some of them have the common personality like the pervert, the overly protective main character and the defenseless girl but somehow they are all fantastic when seen together and they also have unique characteristics. (Take Note: I mistook Edward as a girl and Al as a robot, I am so stupid, am I the only one though?)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If giving enjoyment an infinity I would've done it by now but sadly it’s only a ten. This anime has outstanding puns, dramatic parts, a little romance, overwhelming action scenes and an ending that no words could describe my feelings because it was the best one. (Thank you Arakawa!) FMA: B was the first shounen anime that made me cry. There were episodes that were just too intense that I never expected to shed a tear. The jokes were funny and were not corny. Yeah sure some of it was always shown but they place the jokes at the right time without confusing the person and making the viewers say “what the hell am I watching?” There weren’t too many ecchi scenes in Brotherhood because like I said it is pretty straightforward. Action scenes were not too dull. They preserved the specialness in every character’s strengths and weaknesses in order to give out their true power in the end. Romance? Well, I can't believe that it has one but don’t worry, the show doesn't focus much on the love story.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a great story line, lovable characters that you won’t forget, unmistakably exquisite music and sound effects, a different art and amusing parts there is no denying that you should really NOT miss FMA: B. I am not saying this because I am a fan, I am saying this because I am a victim of watching an extraordinary anime that never left my mind. I was thinking about this anime for like weeks now and there isn't a second or a minute that I never wait for the next episode. I will always admire this anime because of its strong capability to make a person learn about sacrifices and pain. Life is cruel but in the end, you’ll know that everyone needs to lose something to gain what you really want. Just like what Edward said, “A lesson without pain is meaningless” so you have to stand and endure it. You shouldn't miss Fullmetal but instead have the time to watch it and you will be captivated. It wasn't ranked as number one in MAL for no reason. Because of FMA: B, I finally learned to move on and keep moving forward. If you haven't watched it yet, you will lose half of your life and your limbs.\n",

      "This anime is easily one of my all time favourite anime, and I have yet to meet someone who genuinely dislikes it. It's worth a shot, and I know you'll fall in love with it, just like I did. Watch it all and there will definitely be a least one character you love and at least one part of the story you will always remember.\n",
      "The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a fantastic anime back in 2004. It had a fantastic story, and amazing characters, but unfortunately, the pacing was slow, and the ending was somewhat bittersweet. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, it's remake, on the other hand manages to fix just about every problem the original had, and even manages to improve all the good points from the original.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of the Fullmetal is one not to forget. The story revolves Edward Elric, and his brother, Alphonse Elric, who are searching for a way to return back to their original lives after committing a dangerous taboo, human transmutation. The story revolves around\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "the idea that in order to receive something, you must sacrifice something of equal value. The brothers live in a fantasy-like militaristic nation that has a great focus on the use of alchemy called Amestris. This is an incredible story that uses it's time wisely, with just about every moment having a importance in the grander scheme of things. Not everything is as it seems, as they are some really clever plot twist you won’t forget. Despite the fact the the story is massive, it never seems to complicated. It explains everything in a way that it doesn't talk down to you, but you never feel like you've been given to much info to keep track of either.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The best part of the anime by far, are the characters. The show has a huge cast of likable characters, each with own interesting personalities. None of the characters feel like stereotypes, and they are all given enough depth to make them feel alive. There’s the main dou, Edward and Alphonse Elric, two brothers who are searching for a way to get their original bodies back, and their childhood friend, Winry, who is always making sure the two brothers are safe. There’s also the members of the military, Roy Mustang, a man who wishes to become the fuhrer of Amestris, with his devoted team, and a loving father and husband, Hughes. And, of course, the antagonists of the show, the mysterious homunculi whose motives see, unclear at first, and a man looking for revenge, Scar. I haven’t even mentioned the side characters. Ninjas, Alchemy teachers, engineers, and a runaway father. Hell, I don’t even know if I can call these side characters. They're all so important, with their own different goals and character development, they could be considered all to be part of the main cast. They are all so varied, you’re bound to have your own favorites.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation for the show is great too, although some might prefer the originals art style over this one. It looks a bit more simpler compared to the originals, but that’s mainly because the original had some fantastic artwork. I will say this, though. The animation is great and has some incredible action scenes, and nice facial expressions. The art style is beautiful as well, creating fantastic environments, with a great use of distinct colors. The animation does fall once in a while, but it’s so rare, you’ll hardly notice it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And finally, the sound. This show has a fantastic orchestrated soundtrack, with solid voice acting. The anime has five opening and ending songs, and they’re all a joy to listen to. The music complements the show greatly. Every scene is backed up by a great track, giving them all it’s intended atmosphere. It can make scenes intense or relaxing, exiting or melancholic, and most importantly, meaningful. The only complaint I would have is that some of these tracks are played too often, but it never really bothered me. The voice actors for this show are great as well. There’s not really a weak voice actor in the bunch, and some of them really do help push the characters to seem more believable. You can’t go wrong with either subbed or dubbed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can’t stop praising this show enough. The show is incredible, with practically no flaws(I tried my best to even find the few nitpicks that I did find). You’ll end up finding these episodes passing by too fast, with these 64 episodes will all hold something memorable. This is not a show you want to miss.\n",
      "FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood was released in 2009 and it is a remake of the FullMetal Alchemist, where the story takes another path and twist from the original. Brotherhood is considered to be better than the original from most of its viewers.The whole animation has deep meanings as its designed based on facts and different cultures, Its not just a random put-together. It has a good way of transmitting the anime's emotions such as comedy style and drama, and will definitely make you laugh sometimes , and other times feel sad or even cry.\r\n",

The movement is smooth and the physic in the anime are as realistic as they can considering its a fantasy world with super extra special effects! It has Naturalistic colors which will not make your eyes hurt and the design of things around is pretty interesting as well. For an anime released in 2009 it has awesome details. Characters are well designed and give you the exact face expressions depending on the situation.\r\n",
      "Art: The openings and the ending of the series are awesome as they have great music and awesome design. As every anime openings of course they are kinda spoily as they show things from the series that have not happened yet. The anime has awesome soundtracks in general where they fit perfectly on the situation.\n",

Alchemy is the science where you can take matter , Understand it , dissolve it and then put it back together in something different. All people there can do it pretty much , at least people that are practising the art. Out protagonist tried to follow a forbidden alchemy type when their mother passed away. Wanting to bring their mother back they applied what can be said as human alchemy. The process backfired and Edward lost his leg while his little brother lost his whole body. Edward not knowing what to do he sacrificed his arm to tie his brother soul on an iron armor. After they survived Edward had surgery to apply prosthetic parts and his brother remained as an armor. Now Edward applies to work for the military thinking that he has a chance to find a way to discover the Philosophers Stone, a legendary ingredient which will help him and his brother recover their bodies. The questions are so many that they dont know where to start looking. What are the creatures called homunculus that have the name of the seven sins? What is their connection with the Stone and the way to immortality? Will the two brother stay together until the end or will the guilt consume them?\n",

The plot doesn't only move around the protagonists as all characters in the series are interesting and have an awesome story. \n",

      "In Depth Details: The whole world in the animation seems to be Germanized as for starters there is a Fuhrer in the anime. The state alchemists are called dogs of the military and in general the story is very militarized. There is this extermination of the Ishval where i can connect it with gypsies due to their lifestyle , cultural similarities and the fact that Germany killed about 1 million Romans(gypsies) during the war and also the war on multiple fronts. There is also an obsession with the occult in the high ranking members. If you have watched the original FullMetal Alchemist you will see that at the end of the series and the movie, it takes place in Germany 1923 on hitler's age  where the German Nazis are looking for power to invade other countries.\r\n",
      "According to the writer: Arakawa has stated she didn't use any specific countries or cultures to create Amestris, but rather a combination of several European countries from several different periods between the 17th and 19th centuries and, more specifically, the changes that occurred in the Western Europe during the Industrial Revolution (with a greater inspiration in England). According to her, however, there's no implied relation or comparison to any specific country, time, or government.\n",
      "Before watching Brotherhood, I've watched the original series few years back. FMA 1 was good and awesome too, but the thing I hated about it is that the ending is not tragic and is not satisfying. So, knowing that there was an another adaptation of the series made me all curious about it.\n",

      "Since I enjoyed watching Brotherhood, I never realized I finised watching the whole thing in just one week.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\", you may ask? Well, at the first few episodes, the pacing of the plot was pretty fast, for someone who have watched the original FMA before. But, if you were not aware of the original\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "series, maybe the pacing would be okay for you. It was not as detailed as the first series, but since there are new additions to the plot, new friends and enemies, and fuller character development, especially with Winry [who was just a minor supporting character in the original series] and of course, with the Elric Brothers, you won't bother about the pacing and embrace these awesome changes instead.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story plot was different from the original FMA; the first 6 episodes were adapted from FMA1, and the next episodes were all different. Since this plot was faithful to the manga, you'll be surprised... and happy, that there are new things to discover in Brotherhood, as I've mentioned above. The addition of the east country of Xing and the northern Briggs, and their corresponding characters, was like a breath of fresh air to the series, as we can see and expect more stories and more types of alchemy and auto-mail. Also, the origins, forms, and the battles against the homunculi were totally different too. The fight scenes were all amazing. Yes, there are bloodbaths here and there, but that's the part I love the most while watching them fight, whether by weapons, alchemy, or simply a fist-to-fist battle.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maybe the part I love the most in watching FMA is on the last few episodes. The ending was simply touching, since  Edward still sacrificed something for his younger brother, but in Brotherhood, he sacrificed something different... and less tragic. I also loved the part where Ed, Al, and Hohenheim worked together when they fought with Father, and I simply cried when Hohenheim said to Trisha's grave that he's happy that at last, Edward called him \"Dad\". The ending of FMA 1 was disturbing and not really satisfying, whereas in the ending of Brotherhood, you will love it so much you will wish for a sequel... or an afterstory perhaps.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art and animation in Brotherhood was clearer, more crisp, and lot more contemporary than the original, as expected from a recently-produced series. I'm not really that particular about how the anime was drawn or animated, but Brotherhood was one of the exemptions to it. The battles were not crappy, and I really got creeped out when the \"immortal army\" was released [the white doll-like humans] from the Central underground.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The seiyuus have done a good job in portraying their roles in Brotherhood, especially Ed and Al's. I also love the OPs and EDs used in Brotherhood, especially \"Hologram\", which was the second OP and surprisingly the last ED of the series. The background music used were perfectly synched with the scenes in a particular episode. After watching the series, you will definitely want to listen to the whole OST.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of the kinds of characters in Brotherhood-- from the heroes, supporting characters, new characters, and to the villains-- it wasn't possible NOT to love at least one of these kinds. I even loved the character of Greed, who was a bad-turned-good character, and in the end, found satisfaction from his comrades. Also, the guys from Xing were also amazing, especially May, which inspired Al to study eastern alchemy in the latter parts of the story. Also, the addition of Alex Armstrong's older sister was also awesome, and also one of my favorite new characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And most especially, I love how Winry was turned into a REALLY important character in the series, and how Ed masked his OBVIOUS liking to her.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I loved the series. I laughed with it. I cried like a baby, especially whenever Ed shows his selfless nii-san love for Al. I was intrigued with every ending of the episode, which was one of the reasons I finished the whole thing in a week. The series was not a disappointment in my part, and it made me wish that all of the other remakes would be AS GOOD as this. This is a quick recommend to my friends who love to watch shounen and for those who were familiar with the original FMA, because Brotherhood was told in the manga's point of view, and the story came in full circle in the end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Right now, I am suffering from a post-anime series depression, which I think will last a few weeks or more. It's not because the series was bad, rather, Brotherhood was too good for me to finish quickly. All my friends who've watched Brotherhood had the same feeling: the feeling of not watching any anime series for a few weeks before moving on, since when you finished watching Brotherhood, it would feel that a part of you ended with it. After watching the series, I was stunned for a few minutes, and told myself \"This is it; I finished FMA Brotherhood. What will happen next?\"\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good addition to the anime series you should watch before you die [LOL, but seriously]. If you like more action, NO filler episodes, and a satisfying ending, this one's for you.\n",
      "Full Metal Alchemist is the work of mangaka Arakawa Hiromu, and is undoubtedly her most famous work. While an anime series under the name of Full Metal Alchemist did air in 2003-2004, the actual manga itself had not finished at that point and, as a result, the ending differs significantly from the actual manga’s ending. Airing in 2009-2010, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (henceforth referred to just as FMA) rectified this. Finally viewers were able to experience the joy of the entire Full Metal Alchemist story adapted to anime format – and what a joy it is.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA is very quick in establishing an action-packed storyline, soon\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "evolving from the small-scale tale of two boys trying to find a way to recover their bodies into an epic quest to save the people of the nation of Amestris from being literally devoured, as a family of homunculi seek to gain the power of God (perhaps the Japanese ‘Kami’ is more appropriate here, as this God is more of a divine lifeforce than a fully-fledged supreme being). One of the coolest parts about FMA’s storyline, and this came as quite a surprise to me, was how dramatically the pacing slows down in the last quarter. These last 16 episodes represent only about 2 days’ worth of the story, and from this point on everything really is switched up to 11. The action definitely is amped up from this point on, but so too are the personal stories of our characters. It’s hugely rewarding to follow all the mini-storylines as they comes together for the story’s suitably epic conclusion. Without going into any spoilers, the ending to FMA was as close to perfection as I think anime will ever get.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA succeeds on multiple levels, being an accomplished mixture of the more enjoyable and light-hearted fights and comedy that a good shounen needs, with a very mature and intelligent approach to the personalities of the characters. It straddles the line between a more adult philosophical anime and a shounen anime placing action first and foremost, dedicating equal time to both these approaches. This is possible largely thanks to the concept of alchemy – the superhuman powers alchemy grants its user is almost absolute. The theme of humans playing god is heavily prevalent in the show, as is the concept of religion in general (Never is the maxim ‘advanced science is indistinguishable from miracles’ more applicable than in the case of alchemy in FMA). It’s a very compelling topic of discussion, and one happily that FMA doesn’t fail to address. The first mini-story of the show, set in the religious town of Leto, is designed to introduce you to our main characters, is focused exactly on this idea, with a healthy dose of action and drama for good measure.\n",

      "Without further ado though, let’s look at the characters of FMA and why it is this aspect of FMA that is truly what sets the show apart. These characters are what drive the show’s considerable runtime to be a constantly entertaining and, thankfully, filler free experience. I counted about 30 characters who received decent development in the story, an astonishing figure when you consider that’s a character being fully developed every 2 episodes!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It probably won’t come as a shock to you, but it soon becomes apparent when watching FMA that the characters were its biggest strength. This is not only due to the fact that none of them stick to the archetypes loved by many (myself included), but because of how many of the leading characters are both physically and emotionally scarred. Our main characters, Edward and Alphonse, strive to save the world, but not because it is a simple driving principle that they live by, but because they need a solution to atone for their sins. This is not an uncommon driving force in FMA: the Ishbalan war soldiers, Lieutenant Hawkeye, Major Armstrong and Colonel Mustang, are also examples of characters living with regret, as is Scar, an Ishabalan hunted by the country and determined to exact revenge on the soliders of Amestris for killing his entire race! These characters are spending the bulk of their lives having to deal with the consequences for their actions. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is why the primary villains of the series, the homunculi, are so much more important than just punching bags. Each homunculus is named after one of the seven deadly sins, and overcoming and defeating the sins that our cast bears is brilliantly exemplified by the action-packed battles with the antagonists. These details add fantastic depth to what could easily have been a very plain ‘stopping bad-guys trying to take over the world’ situation. In a normal shounen anime, I would normally say overcoming enemy after enemy is not the same as character development, but in the case of FMA, it very much is. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist makes full (hehe) use of the wonderful opportunities the writer has set up to allow the characters to flourish as humans, not just ideals with bodies or walking plot devices. As a result, the tragedies that befall these characters are not only obstacles for them to overcome. No, they are genuine disasters that scar these characters in longer-lasting and character defining ways. It is the way that the characters are shaped by the actions that surround them that gives them such relatable and loveable traits. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I won’t spend too long on the animation and music section of FMA, because this review is getting long enough as it is! The sound and music of FMA is something I regularly look back on fondly, because there’s not a moment where it slips up. Voice acting is perfectly cast, and Edward’s squeal when someone calls him short never gets old. The theme songs for FMA are also consistently on point, starting strong with Yui’s fantastic ‘Again’ and never looking back, especially impressive due to the fact that FMA switches up its OP and ED a total of 5 times in its 65 episode running time. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "By contrast, if there’s one thing that Full Metal Alchemist doesn’t excel in, it’s the animation. It does the job and is pleasing to look at, but isn’t anything that you would write home about: character movements are smooth and some of the alchemical constructions are pretty impressive, but that’s pretty much that. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "To wrap-up, FMA is that rare breed of shounen anime where the difficulties the characters face are solved by brains sometimes just as much as they are by brawn, but FMA doesn’t stop there. The characters are all likeable, well-rounded and intensely well-written people. Such is the complete quality of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood that, over the course of writing this review, my analysis of the characters and their situations has led me to respect them even more than I did having just finished the series for a second time.\n",
      "So in honor of FMA Day 2014 (I know I'm a bit late), I've decided to write a review for my #1 all-time favorite anime (and manga), Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Honestly, I don't know what I could say about this show that hasn't already been said, but I'll give it a shot anyway.\r\n",
      "I'm not going to do what I typically do for a review which is listing the categories and what score I gave them; just know that everything is 10/10. \r\n",
      "I'm also going to address some critique that I've seen of the show and why I agree/disagree with it.\r\n",
      "Also I'm avoiding talking about the 03\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "anime because as far as I'm concerned it doesn't exist.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I apologize in advance for this wall of text.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of this show is absolutely phenomenal. Not only does it manage to tell the story of the main two characters, Ed and Al, it also gives ample time to all the other characters to show where they come from and how they think. And the show does this all without losing steam or taking long breaks from the action, and also without having characters monologuing in the middle of fights. There's also plenty of comedy, but it never once ruins the mood of the show (cough cough Pandora Hearts).\r\n",
      "People like to bash on the rushed beginning of the show, but the reason for the rushed beginning is called Fullmetal Alchemist 2003. Brotherhood quickly sped through the episodes that the 2003 anime had already covered because the good stuff was yet to come. If the pacing at the beginning isn't appealing to you, I'd suggest also watching the corresponding episodes of the original anime. That pacing is more true to the manga's. Plus, after the first 13 or so episodes of Brotherhood, the pacing slows down but, once again, without losing steam. Once the show hits episode 15, new characters that weren't in the 2003 adaptation appear and immediately take part in the story. But the new characters don't stop there. They keep appearing for a long while after that.\r\n",
      "Everything in the story is so flawlessly executed that even this type of anime isn't your thing, you can't help but admire how perfectly everything fits together and how many pains the author took in planning every step of the story. Then when you go back and watch the show again, you realize all the subtle foreshadowing that was carefully placed and not obvious enough that you pick up on it before it happens.\r\n",
      "This show is technically classified as a shounen anime, though I tend to cringe at that because FMAB isn't really a shounen. If you compare it to a more typical shounen such as Soul Eater, you begin to realize just how different it is. In Brotherhood, there's no yelling out the names of attacks, no long breaks in fights to monologue about plans, and the alchemy used isn't seen as an unquestionable staple of the world. Alchemy itself constantly called into question and many times the characters are forced to ask themselves if it's morally right to use alchemy to change the course of the world (whereas in Soul Eater they don't really debate the morality of the souls they collect). \r\n",
      "Overall, even people that don't like anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I've gotten several of my friends (as well as my dad) into anime using this show as a beginning step. If you watch the dub and ignore the obvious fact that it's animated, it doesn't seem like what people typically perceive as an anime at all. It's on a whole other level from everything else I've seen.\r\n",
      "In addition, Brotherhood sticks to the manga nearly perfectly (the only things cut out were some minor character development and comedy scenes). Considering Studio Bones has a tendency to deviate from the source material (see: Ouran, Soul Eater, Noragami, FMA 03, etc.), with this show they did an admirable job with delivering an adaptation so accurate that you can read/watch one and not have to watch/read the other, even though I'd recommend doing both because of the anime's gorgeous art and music and the manga's few forgotten moments and the slightly different chapter divides.\r\n",
      "Because Brotherhood was put into production when the manga was wrapping up, the show avoids filler episodes (possible exceptions include episodes 1 and 27, in which 1 simply introduces the characters and some foreshadowing and 27 is basically a recap episode that also provides some hints at foreshadowing). If you miss an episode of the show, chances are you'll be very confused as to what is happening. Each episode smoothly leads into the next and they're pretty much unskippable. If it's your first or even second time watching the show, I wouldn't recommend skipping even the fillers because of the foreshadowing they provide. I've seen firsthand how confused the \"fillers\" can make people while I laugh and say that it'll be explained later. And it will. Everything gets explained so clearly, yet all the subtle ways in which the plot points connect amazes me every time I watch the show.\r\n",
      "As far as worldbuilding, I give triple thumbs-up to Hiromu Arakawa. She created multiple countries and while we don't get to see too much of life back home (I still want a Xing spinoff), the ideology of the foreigners and how it conflicts with the Amestrian characters' clearly shows. On top of that, Arakawa designed a government system which plays a crucial role in the story (then again, everything plays a crucial role in the story), as well as all of the laws and finer points of how the country is run. I've seen several other animes in which the government is used a plot point, but none of them use government quite as effectively as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood does. So many side stories and spinoffs could potentially grow out of the complex world Arakawa created.\r\n",
      "Sorry for writing so much about the story, but there's a lot to write about.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art and animation are amazing. Not as sharp as Attack on Titan, maybe, but it definitely fulfills all expectations. The battle animation is fluid and well executed, there's subtle use of CGI at certain points, the alchemy lightning is pleasing to watch, and the backgrounds are nicely detailed and do well to set the mood. Some people have said that it's simpler than the 03 anime's style, but I honestly can't see it. If anything, I find it more detailed. There's a few moments in which the same shot is used for more than a few seconds, as well as moments where the characters don't move around very much, but this is a minor detail and excusable considering the top-notch fight animation. There are no dips in quality throughout the show, and everything is handled as one would expect a high-budget anime to be handled.\r\n",
      "One of the things I especially love about the art in FMAB is the subtle aging of the characters. They age gradually, like real people, and you don't even notice the process happening until you look back on their appearances at the beginning and realize how much they've changed.\r\n",
      "In addition, the women of FMAB are completely unsexualized as well as totally kickass. After watching other animes with copious amounts of fanservice, only now can I appreciate this anomaly and not take it for granted\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I really loved the music in this show. While I felt that some tracks were overplayed in the beginning, this becomes less of a problem toward the end of the show because tunes you haven't heard before are suddenly revealed. The opening and ending songs are also very pretty and catchy (though I'm not too big a fan of the third ED), with my personal favorite opening being the last one. However, the first and fourth openings are awesome as well, and I think the first one in particular captures the mood of the show. I also loved the synchronization of some of the sequences to the songs, which I think is a very nice touch.\r\n",
      "As far as voice acting, I've seen this anime both dubbed and subbed, and while I like the dub more, both versions are really good. The actors are spot-on as their characters, and I love how they managed to get most of the voice actors from the 2003 anime back for Brotherhood. Even Alphonse's '03 dub actor, Aaron Dismuke, came back, though not as Al because he was too old at that point; instead he voices a minor but important character. Overall, the voice acting in both English and Japanese was really good, and it's safe to go with whichever one you're more comfortable with (though personally I'd say go with the dub because that way you can concentrate on the pretty art and animation).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are simply outstanding. Not only do they all get their backstories thoroughly explored, they all develop and change throughout the show. I've seen a lot of people griping about the fact that the show pretty much completely changes themes from the beginning, but the theme change is BECAUSE the characters changed. Wow, characters can change? Like real people?! I had no idea!\r\n",
      "Whenever I'm getting people into this show, I tell them, \"If you see a character that you kind of like, don't worry, because their backstory will be explained.\" And they always seem kind of doubtful, but in the end they realize that it's true.\r\n",
      "Another reason why I hold this show in the highest regards is that there are many different races, cultures, and religions being portrayed; and while some characters make racist comments, the cultures themselves are treated with the highest respect. The episode detailing the events in Ishval is one of the most grim of the show; the Ishvalans being handled by the story as carefully as if they were a real race.\r\n",
      "The romance in this show develops subtly and beautifully and never once hijacks the plot. In addition, while it's amusing to watch Ed and Winry struggling with their feelings for each other, Ed does something pretty atypical for a protagonist: He blames himself for making Winry upset, and not because she got mad at him, but because he knows he should have been there for her. It's not all that often you see the male protagonist apologizing for causing the female protagonist grief.\r\n",
      "On top of how well-rounded and three-dimensional all of the characters are, they're all very well designed. Each one of them looks and moves differently according to their personality, and a lot of the characters change outfits regularly (which doesn't seem like much, but it's the little things that count, especially considering most animes don't do this and a lot of them have some kind of uniform, school or otherwise, to avoid having to have the characters changing outfits).\r\n",
      "All in all, every one of the characters in FMAB leave a lasting impression on the viewer, whether they were in the show for one episode or all of them. It's so hard to pick a favorite.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even though this show, at 64 episodes, is the longest anime I've seen yet, it's such a fast watch that it honestly doesn't feel like it. While I personally haven't set any records with the speed of my watching, friends of mine have finished the show in time periods from 2-4 days, because of the sheer addictiveness of it. And the show IS addictive. Every few months I get a strong urge to rewatch it and cry all over again. And while I'll never completely forget every detail, every time I rewatch it I'm still blown away. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This show draws you in with the seriousness of the story, the depth of the characters, the gorgeous art and sound, and pretty much every other detail you can think of. To sum it up, if you want a viewing experience on a whole other level from anything you've seen, if you want an ending that will make you break down and rethink your life, if you've seen the original FMA and enjoyed it, watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's not the #1 rated anime on MAL by accident, and it'll definitely always be my #1.\n",
      "One thing I distinctly remember about the 12 year old me was a fear of becoming a mega nerd who watched anime. I enjoyed video games but didn’t want to plunge headlong into the void I saw before me. Well, times changed and I found myself watching my first anime at a college friend’s behest. In 2011 I found myself entranced with the deep and exciting world of Fullmetal Alchemist and the story of the two Elric brothers as they journeyed to redeem themselves. The ending to that first series, however, was a letdown that shook my good impressions of the strong opening. That opinion\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "remains to this day.\r\n",
      "\tA few months later I recounted my experiences to my friend and, to my surprise, he replied that a retelling of the series had recently finished which remained faithful to the source material. After a few months, I sat down on Netflix and watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The whole time I wondered: can the series be better than the original? Could the already great relationship I encountered between the two brothers be deepened? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story:\t\r\n",
      "First, I’d like to explain the story. Two brothers, Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Elric, live in the mysterious land of Amestris where Alchemy is a science practiced by those gifted with this strange ability. The Elric brothers grow up in their hometown with their childhood friend Winry and their mother until a plague comes through the area. Tragically, their mother passes away in the epidemic but Edward and Alphonse resolve to see their mother’s smile once more. They study from books their absent father left behind and attempt to do the forbidden: bring the dead to life. Needless to say the attempt turns horribly wrong and the series then focuses on the siblings trying to return themselves back to normal. \r\n",
      "What separates Brotherhood from its original 2003 counterpart is not really apparent at first. The brothers commit the same horrible act and what immediately follows is eerily similar. When the story reaches Dublith, however, Brotherhood begins to tell a new story. The result, I am delighted to say, is an exciting epic that twists and turns throughout the whole of the mythical world Hiromu Arakawa has laid out for us. The purpose for which the two brothers fight becomes deeper and deeper without ever losing sight of what originally drove the two to join the fight in the first place; and the resolve of the Elric brothers is pushed to the limit in ways you would never think possible. The ending is especially epic as the underlying philosophy of the show comes to light. It’s amazing to see a show that does this well in the end and Brotherhood deserves every ounce of praise it gets for its story\r\n",
      "Sadly, it would be a lie to claim this story is perfectly told. Both the very beginning and middle section of the series suffer from pacing issues. To be frank, the beginning is often criticized for the choice to gloss over material covered in the 2003 counterpart.  While all the material is there, you might be wishing for just a little more explanation before the show continues at full speed. The middle section of the anime also suffers from a pacing issue, but this time it’s too slow. While it was nice to take a breather from the action immediately preceding this section, Brotherhood falters as it introduces the final set of characters that will join in the epic climax. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "24/25\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters:\r\n",
      "Probably the most remarkable aspect of the original Fullmetal Alchemist series back in 2003 was the goofy and touching bond between the two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric. The rapid back and forth between the two served as an ideal backdrop to explore the two brothers’ personalities. Fortunately this bond was not only kept with the new series, but taken to even higher heights. Seeing the two in action was truly a delight. \r\n",
      "One of the exciting things about Brotherhood was a truly diverse cast with characters that fairly consistently avoided the cardboard character models that are so easy to fall into. Minor characters that stand out include Yoki, Maes Hughes, and of course Lust. But what makes the series memorable is the diverse cast of characters with their own motivations. Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye are trying to atone for the crimes of the Ishvallan war of extermination and build a better world no matter what the cost. General Armstrong seeks to make Amestris as strong as it can possibly be and fights to make it so. And even the enemies have motivations that sum up to more than a simple “we must stop the main protagonists at all costs.” Brotherhood massively succeeds in making the story engaging through its exciting cast, and I feel as if the story is as wonderful as it is because of the well-developed characters in this series.       \n",
      "\r\n",
      "24/25\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Animation:\r\n",
      "Of course no animated series can exist without the medium of animation to carry facial expressions and convey action. To this respect, Brotherhood improves upon the solid foundations left by the 2003 series and the manga.  I particularly enjoy the character designs, but animation experts have raved about the fantastic fight scenes the series boasts. One animator, Yoshimichi Kameda, has received extensive praise for his touches and innovations in the Sakuga of several major fight scenes. Aside from that there are a few instances where the animation gets a little derpy and the chibi animation can sometimes interfere with the overall gravity of the plot; but I find it refreshing that a series so epic takes a small breather every now and then.\n",

      "16/17.5\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound:\r\n",
      "With regards to the overall sound of the show, I felt as if there was some solid work put in on the part of Akira Senju. Unfortunately, the music of the series does begin to grind on you as the show reaches the climatic final scenes. This is alleviated somewhat by the execution of the music in the show as it never overpowers the quietest moments and never is lost even in the thick of combat. One major plus in my book is the work done by Funimation in their Dub of the show. Vic Mignogna delivers again in his reprise of Edward Elric and the rest of the English cast is, for the most part, quite solid. As I am not a native speaker of Japanese I generally prefer watching the Dub when I can so I am able to more effectively judge the quality of the voice acting; and the English cast is phenomenal. If I had to comment on the original voice acting performed in Japanese I would remark that the Voice actor for Edward sounds much younger than an American 15 year old would sound… Haters gonna hate.\t\t\n",

      "Accessibility:\r\n",
      "Finally, I would be negligent to recommend or condemn this series without mentioning the appropriateness of the series to all ages. While I do feel as if the series is a masterfully told story, there are elements that prohibit me from recommending this adventure to all. Most notably the dark one and violence make this series a no go for anyone under the age of 15. If you doubt me watch episode 4 and tell me it isn’t dark. Also it seems like every shonen series has an uncontrollable urge to throw in a tub scene with the main love interest. Obviously this isn’t family friendly. While complete nudity is not an issue, this series is not guitless when it comes to the regrettable trend of fanservice and innuendo. \t\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment factor:\r\n",
      "I loved Brotherhood… Enough said, and seeing as it tells a complete story that examines and plays out different philosophies as part of its intricate design, it seems as if Brotherhood will continue to be my most enjoyable TV experience for a long time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many people have lauded Brotherhood since its completion and I am happy to include myself in their number. The sheer glory of the ending is a masterpiece that needs to be seen to believe, though the barrier of entry regrettably limits the audience of the series. For these reasons I rate Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood with a score of 92 out of 100 and grade the series as a Diamond rated show. Brotherhood is a monument to anime done well, and is a testament to a story told superbly. The combination of quality animation and well developed characters provide the perfect backdrop to a tale of two brothers. A tale where redemption is just beyond their reach.\n",
      "When the original Fullmetal Alchemist came out in 2003, it was apparent that it followed the manga at first, but them went on it's path. Which didn't make it bad, but it annoyed many people, including me (Even though I didn't watch it until about 9 or 10 years after it came out.) \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But! Our fandom had been blessed with a reboot of the series that follows the manga, and is pretty damn good. I have been intimidated to write about this series because well, it's too awesome to tackle with reviews. \n",

      "\r\n",
      "What especially loved was the fact that the story flowed so nicely, even though when I first watched it I was confused during the first 13 episodes because I had watched FMA '03 before hand. You should probably wait a little bit before diving into this series after finished the original. It may seem the same, but it's a whole different ball park. However, no questions are left unanswered, and there are a lot of feels involved. \n",

      "There's also the standard; 'Anime serious face' and the 'anime goofing off face'. EX: Ouran High school host club. I think BONES did really well, with character detail. But not so much with background animation, things seemed a bit off there. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. \n",

It builds the relationships in tandem with the drama to show us something that isn't perfect, but is so clearly superior to Sakura's friendship speeches and although the dialogue at times felt subpar, it never felt completely pointless.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The action scenes, too, were rarely drawn out unnecessarily and were all beautifully crafted. I'm crossing my fingers that more shows will get their brotherhood, because although this series is longer than the original it felt more focused, and certainly it ended up feeling more meaningful. I may have given few hours to this show, but I feel equivalent exchange was not at play here because it has given me a lot more than I was expecting.\n",
      "This is one of the greatest anime of all time.  I know that's kind of bold statement to make but in my opinion it is one of the greats and my personal favorite.  The story is great and is paced so well especially in comparison to FMA 03 the original adaption.  This anime's greatest strength is its story and characters because its characters are just that characters not cardboard cutout archetypes.  For example Winry Rockbell starts the show as this stereotypical childhood friend who is always keeping the main heroes in line but while she continues that she expands with a\n",

The two main protagonist are Edward and Alphonse Elric who are excellently written as the short-tempered leader who just wants to protect who he loves in Edward and Alphonse as such a  softy who just wants do what's right in his quest for his body.  The story as I said before has excellent pacing moving from gripping drama to bits of humor to intense action seemlessly.  I'm not going to say this is perfect because it isn't some of fights lack speed and weight in the animation.  Speaking of which the animation isn't anything to write home about in my opinion keep in mind I watch this in 2014 so for its time its above average.  The sound overall is quite good the theme was carried from FMA which isn't a problem and the openings are much improved with the first standing out.  Overall its at least worth watching to get your own idea of it\n",

      " Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is undoubtedly one of the most popular animes out there, and for a good reason. It follows two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric who attempted to bring their mother back to life with the most forbidden alchemy: Human Transmutation.

In a desperate attempt to keep his brother with him, Edward willingly sacrificed his right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. Edward bound Al's soul to a suit of armor he\n",

      " This plot is perfectly explained in the original anime \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". It's like they created this with the thought that everyone watched the original first. I would highly recommend watching the first one if you want more insight on the transmutation, or reading the manga version. \r\n",
      " I also criticized the art style to be a little cartoony for my taste, but gave it a  8. The style itself is clean and fresh but feels very simplistic. However, overtime when you watch this anime- one of my favorite parts is that the characters do not stay the same age. The characters grow in the story as you watch, and you don't realize it until you see the teenage protagonist actually looks like a young adult in comparison to the 12 year old you once got introduced to. \r\n",
      " The soundtrack is wonderful, it's a great listen. The openings also make the characters grow/change like in the anime. When you see them separately, and look at them side-by-side, you'll see the growth. One of the most uniquest things I have ever seen in an Anime. \r\n",
      " The characters in FMAB, are all lovely. They each have there own story/quest. In the end, you really enjoy watching them grow with the protagonists and see them help Edward and Alphonse reach there goal including there own. \r\n",
      " Overall, this anime is wonderful and heartbreaking, and will make you laugh and cry. Even though this anime has flaws, I gave a 10 because of the wonderful journey it gave me. Its truly a treat.  It's a beautiful story you will honestly never forget.\n",

      "For me it's very important that it does not only have strong male characters but also very strong female characters. I personally love animes (and mangas) that have very strong females and that doesn't go for the more typical type of female that we often see in animes and mangas. \n",

      "Best show I've ever seen.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably the best series I've ever seen. There are several reasons for this: \n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) The story is truly compelling! It really grows on you, since the viewer wants the Elric brothers to reach their goal of getting their bodies back, because of their hard childhood, where their dad left home and their mother died. You grow a sympathy towards these two boys. The plot is amazing, though I don't want to spoil anything. The idea of Alchemy is great in my opinion. So I'll give the story: 10/10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) The art is top notch, the fighting scenes are\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "amazing and the backgrounds are beautiful. The characters are well-made and they actually seem really human, though they are animated. (Wrath's fighting scenes are awesome!) - Art: 9/10 (almost 10/10l)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) The sounds in FMA Brotherhood is good, but still the show's weakest aspect. Sometimes the background music doesn't really fit, but it doesn't bring down the show. The opening and closing songs are really good, the second opening is one of my favourite Japanese songs. The genereal sounds and talking are good as well. - Sounds deserve a 9/10 (Close to 8/10, due to the background music being out of place at times). \n",
      "\r\n",
      "4) What really made me love FMA: Brotherhood is the characters in the show. They are truly geniously put together. I am a twin brother myself, so I was really touched by Edward's and Alphonse's brotherhood, since I feel that I would go through the same shit as they do, only to help my brother. \r\n",
      "Roy Mustang is a great character, who has quite some shadows of his yesterdays hanging on his shoulders. He has killed many men during some civil wars, which happened in the country. \r\n",
      "Scar is also an important character, who was filled with hatred and seeks revenge on the State Alchemists, who destroyed the Ishbalans, who was Scar's people. \r\n",
      "Louis Armstrong is a fun character, who brings a nice humourous aspect to the show with his Gai Sensei-like emotional and masculine behaviour. \r\n",
      "There are tons of other great characters, I could go on forever, but these were the highlights to me. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "5) All the reasons mentioned above made me enjoy this show more than I've enjoyed any other show. The plot is amazingly well-written and the characters are really believable and sometimes this show just bring the chills, since you really symphatize with the characters. The ending is just perfect, so I'll give FMA: Brotherhood the biggest 10/10 I've ever given to any show.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was the first anime I ever watched, and probably one of the best. The story is pretty simple, it's on MAL so I'm not explaining it. However, I will say this, this anime is sad. You wouldn't expect it from seeing the title or a picture. But this anime is as sad as Clannad: After Story or any other anime that tries to be emotional. I recently rewatched this anime, and I experienced the train ride I had. This anime has so many unexpected moments, especially towards the end. SPOILERS AHEAD: I think that Hughes should have had a bit more screen\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "time, don't get me wrong I want to say that I cried. But the thing that made me sad were the reactions of the other characters with hughes dying. They made the aftermath perfect, but before that,9/10. A bit more and it would be perfect. You learn a lot of things in this anime, They apply to real world situations. Let's face it, when we wish for something big, we always sacrifice something. Like \"I wish for Hoenn to be remade\" Your wish comes true but you lose hope halfway. The characters were very enjoyable, the villains were great as well, Animation and Sound, perfect. Overall, my rating would be 9.9/10 which I would say is near perfect. This anime is incredible, and everyone should watch it. I may be a bit too much of a fanboy, but trust me, you'll love it.\n",
      "Brotherhood boasts that it follows the mangas story more closely than the previous anime adaptation, and it does.  However the actual quality of the anime itself is far poorer.  What realy made FMA's previous anime adaptation so successfull was the overall direction of the anime.  The quality of shots used in this anime and the art itself is inferior to the original anime.  Obviously it is still highly enjoyable due to the story behind it, but the anime seems overhyped.  People feel pressured to believe thats its better due to the story being more accuratly followed.  This is not\n",

      "If there's one programme out there which a tad frustrating for me, it's Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely sick of seeing reviews giving this show a 10/10. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely adore Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole and I do believe that the adventures of Edward and Alphonse should be viewed by all at some point. But it's really the fans' reaction to this show that drive me up a wall. At its core, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great show that does a lot of things right (and I do mean a LOT of shit\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "right) but ends up getting some shit wrong along the way as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, it's important to understand why this show was made before I get started with the actual review itself. Before Brotherhood ever existed, there was the first Fullmetal Alchemist TV series: a loose adaptation of the manga which eventually broke away from the source material in order to tell its own story. Now, this was important for two reasons. The first is because at the time of the first series' creation, there weren't that many chapters there to adapt so either Bones had to wing it or Arakawa had to sacrifice her creative integrity and succumb to both publisher deadlines AND studio pressure as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second reason is the most important: because the first series branched off and became its own entity, that gave Hiromu Arakawa much more time to flesh out the manga's universe and go in the direction she so chooses without having to worry about things like deadlines as much. Talk shit all you want about the first TV series, but just keep in mind that without the first TV series, the manga as we know it right now would be vastly different and Brotherhood would in all likelihood not exist. Of course, the fact that the circumstances behind this show's creation rely so heavily on what went down in the first show does come back to bite Brotherhood in the ass. How so?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well for one thing, the first 15 episodes of Brotherhood are rather... \"rushed,\" I guess? Now, this was actually a stylistic choice on the part of Bones since the logic at the time of creation was that the vast majority of people who are watching this show would have already watched the 2003 series first so they didn't want to bore returning viewers by showing them the same stuff they saw before. While that certainly is a respectable goal, there's only one little problem with that logic: this is supposed to be a REBOOT of the anime series. If you're going to reboot something, any prior entries in the franchise shouldn't even be factored into the equation.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now granted, I did complete Brotherhood first before going on to complete the 2003 series and nothing really seemed out-of-place, but upon re-watching after completing the 2003 series... it just didn't really feel the same. For instance, there's the whole ordeal with Nina Tucker. If you've spent ANY amount of time around the FMA fandom, you should have *some* idea that what happens to this 4-year-old girl is NOT pretty. In the 2003 series however, the Tucker family's role was expanded and we got to see more of Nina before \"it\" happened (and let me just say that the entire thing was fucking depressing after \"it\" happened).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Brotherhood... Nina is just around for one episode and after tragedy befalls her, she's apparently one of the driving forces behind Edward and Alphonse's goals of becoming better alchemists. Let me get this straight: a little girl that you didn't even know for more than a week is going to be one of the driving forces behind our lead protagonists' goals for the entire series' run? Yeah... I'm not buying it. Yes, what happened to her is sad but I find it incredibly hard to believe that an incident like that to someone that Ed and Al barely knew would have THAT much of an impact on them. There are WAY more examples like that than I let on, by the way. I just don't feel like covering them all since that's far too much work on my end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another aspect about Brotherhood I take umbrage with is the comedy. To put it short, I don't really care much for Hiromu Arakawa's chibi-style humour since it just takes me out of the seriousness of the moment and just kills the mood altogether in a vein similar to Kuroshitsuji. Of course, that's not really a fair comparison since Bones is a far more competent studio than A-1 Pictures but it's still something to be mentioned. You can only imagine my frustration whenever I saw Ed go into chibi mode right after some intense action or a relatively serious moment goes down. I mean, yeah it gets a quiet chuckle out of me but do you really have to resort to THAT style of humour to elicit a laugh or two out of the viewers? Come on...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last thing that I don't really have a lot of praise for is the fact that despite the fact that it's definitely a cut above its competition in the battle shonen genre, it still FEELS like a battle shonen series in all the wrong ways from time to time. Don't get me wrong, Hiromu Arakawa really put in a lot of thought and effort into writing up the story and the characters but you can just tell where she got lazy and resorted to using some of the same clichés that plague other battle shonen anime/manga series. They're few and far between, but when they pop up, chances are that you'll instinctively face-palm (especially if there's some bullshit monologue about friendship; I'm looking at you, final fight between Envy and Roy Mustang >_>).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now with all that ugliness out of the way, let's talk positives because hot DAMN is there a lot of praise to give this show. When it comes down to world-building, Hiromu Arakawa is all but unmatched. The world that Brotherhood is set in is masterfully crafted, with a lot of detail put into the locations that each part of the story takes place in. It's quite evident that the biggest reason why the manga took so long to complete would be that Hiromu Arakawa spent a great deal of time fleshing out the finer details of the locations that she brings up. In fact, the only works that I can think of that would be on equal or better footing than Brotherhood would be the likes of Harry Potter, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing that Brotherhood has going for it is the adventure. I don't know about you, but I always found myself enamoured with the new locations and such that Ed and Al would come across on their journeys. From Lior to Fort Briggs and even the ruins of Xerxes, I never cease to find myself captivated by what's going on. What's more is that the adventure from start to finish (with the exception of the first 15 episodes) is incredibly well-paced. No segment of the adventure feels drawn out to the point of being tedious or rushed to the point where nothing of substance actually happens and that segment could've easily been cut out. Each part of the narrative feels necessary to the plot and is given just enough time to make its impact before we move on to the next part of the story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Speaking of which, one of the biggest complaints I see people lodging against the 2003 series is its supposed lack of action. Well Brotherhood makes up for that supposed weakness in full force. At its core, the Fullmetal Alchemist manga is a battle shonen manga and what battle shonen adaptation would be complete without epic fights? All the fights in Brotherhood are perfectly timed, so they're not hideously drawn nor are they dissatisfyingly short. What's more is that battles are only present in episodes where a fight NEEDS to go down for the sake of plot, so there are no pointless fights thrown in for the hell of it so the fights themselves don't detract from the story in the slightest.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Battles, adventures, and a masterfully crafted setting aren't the only thing that Brotherhood has going for it. Surprising though it may be, battle shonen series are actually able to have some damn good drama thrown into the mix which is more than capable of having you emotionally involved with what's going on and that's one of the hallmarks surrounding Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole. Whilst the focus of Brotherhood is more on the adventure than it is the drama, that doesn't stop the show from being able to have more than its fair share of compelling and emotionally involving moments. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last thing that I want to talk about story-wise before I move on to the characters is the ending. The biggest reason why the 2003 series is so divisive amongst FMA fans as a whole is how the series itself actually concluded. The 2003 series' original conclusion was nothing short of bitter-sweet, with a MUCH heavier emphasis on the bitter than the sweet, even in the sequel movie Conqueror of Shamballah. Brotherhood's ending is the exact opposite. It is a happy ending in every sense of the word which fans found INFINITELY more satisfying than what was there previously. As the great Nobuhiro Watsuki said, shonen series are ultimately comics meant for boys and they should have happy endings. Why? Well... boys are young. Save the depressing shit for when they're older and develop a nasty drinking problem.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If there's one area where Fullmetal Alchemist will always succeed (regardless of incarnation), it would definitely have to be with the characters. Of course with that said, Brotherhood is a more event-driven programme rather than character-driven so character development isn't really a priority. For example, Ed and Al more or less remain the same throughout their entire ordeal. They don't degenerate as individuals, yet they also don't improve or even change in any notable way throughout the entire show's run. Regardless, Ed's characterisation is absolutely spectacular.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I really love about Ed's characterisation is the fact that despite going through a great deal of strife in his life, he knows how to laugh and have fun. He rebels against authority from time to time, he and Al fight like brothers do, he has childish outbursts from time to time, etc. What I'm getting at is that despite all of the crap he's gone through, he still behaves like a teenager would. In many ways, Ed reminds me of Peter Parker from the Ultmate Spider-Man comics and that resemblance really does boost him up several notches on my likeability meter. His dynamic with Alphonse is also something that I enjoy quite a bit because it feels a bit like Terry McGinnis/Maxine Gibson's relationship from Batman Beyond.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Alphonse. Throughout the course of Fullmetal Alchemist (this applies to the manga and both TV series), Alphonse more or less remains static throughout the entire show's run and doesn't get any characterisation beyond functioning as the Maxine Gibson to Edward's Terry MicGinnis and being the gentle giant/naive younger sibling. Any sort of subplot that seemed like it would add more to his character don't really play out as such so we're basically back to where we started. Take the part where Al doubts his own humanity for instance. You'd think that would be like a REALLY huge thing, but no... it gets resolved within 1-2 episodes and Al is back to re-transmuting Ed's soul once Winry knocks it out of Ed's body with her wrench... oh well, such is life.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The secondary characters in Fullmetal Alchemist have always been of variable quality, and the same remains true in Brotherhood (perhaps even more so because Brotherhood has a MUCH larger supporting cast). Some characters like Roy Mustang, Greed, Scar, Father, and Fuhrer Bradley are REALLY well-written with their own degrees of complexity while others like Lust, Sloth, and Gluttony didn't really have much to their personality aside from being antagonists. I know that this shit is to be expected, but Hiromu Arakawa REALLY outdid herself when it came down to all this other stuff, and when I don't see that level of quality maintained throughout the work, it just leaves me feeling empty inside. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the technical side of things, Brotherhood is definitely among the best-looking shows that Bones has ever produced, but this is obviously to be expected. Bones is no slouch when it comes down to visual quality. Hell, even shows that they created more than a decade ago like RahXephon and Wolf's Rain hold up pretty damn well in 2014. If I had to sum up my thoughts on the visuals, I'd have to say that Brotherhood's aesthetics are more or less identical to the 2003 show's, but refined. Character designs are more in-line with the manga's, improvements in animation technology allow for less still frames/talking heads present, and what's more is that there's a good deal more background animation present. Speaking of which, Brotherhood's action is bar none some of the most enthralling that I've ever seen in ANY shonen anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another area where Brotherhood excels are in the OPs/EDs. It's rare for me to find an anime that I enjoy have multiple openings, all of which that I actually do like. Personally, I'm biased toward the 5th OP, as it's the opening that really just sets the stage perfectly for the final few episodes of Brotherhood. It has this atmosphere about it where everyone's weary and yet they're so close to their goal that they can't just give up now and that what I'm about to watch really is the home stretch. ED-wise, I'm biased toward the 1st ED because of the animation style as it's all-chibi artwork animated as if it were drawn in pencil with a great track playing over it. That actually brings me over to the audio side of the spectrum.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Audio-wise, Brotherhood doesn't disappoint... asterisk. Now there is one complaint that I have with the OST but that's mostly because the 2003 show's OST is among my all-time favourite anime OSTs and yet Brotherhood just didn't live up to my expectations upon re-watch. This is a similar problem that I had with Hellsing Ultimate in the sense that its predecessor's OST is superior to my ears than the OST that we have for the reboot despite the fact that the one present is REALLY good stuff. There wasn't much in the way of background music that stood out, although it did serve as a complement to whatever was going on and there wasn't anything that I personally found inappropriate for the moment at hand. My favourite OP/ED themes are \"Rain\" and \"Uso\" by SID respectively, just so I can get that out of the way.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dub-wise, Funimation steps up to the plate and delivers in full force. The cast is almost identical to the 2003 series' dub (which is one of my all-time favourite Funimation dubs, by the way), save for certain characters because let's face it: there's no way you can get the same people to work on a project they had a hand in 5-6 years ago all in one place. The most noticeable changes to the cast are Maxey Whitehead replacing Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse, Troy Baker replacing Chris Patton as Greed, J. Michael Tatum replacing Dameon Clark as Scar, and John Swasey aka Gendo Ikari replacing Scott McNeil as Hohenheim.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can safely say that Whitehead, Baker, Tatum, and Swasey all do an excellent job with the roles they were given and are on-par if not better than their predecessors... although I'm biased toward Chris Patton's version of Greed for... reasons. The rest of the dub is spot-on. Vic Mignonga, Travis Willingham, Caitlin Glass, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Laura Bailey, and everyone else who had a hand to play in this dub did an absolutely spectacular job. I'd like to hear dub haters try and talk shit about this dub, because I can't find anything wrong with it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Final thoughts? Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining example of what an adaptation SHOULD do, and yet it baffles me as to how people can consider this to be the best anime ever and something that is infinitely superior to the 2003 series. Despite my preference of the 2003 series, I'd say that they're equals. It's not often we get TWO adaptations which have VERY well-written plots and if you really are a manga purist, you can view the 2003 series as an alternate universe interpretation. Regardless, I absolutely enjoyed watching Brotherhood and I look forward to the day where I can own a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack of the entire show. Both the 2003 series and Brotherhood should be watched by all and both deserve a special place on your shelf of interesting items.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With that said, I'm out. Feedback is always welcome, as are monetary contributions and offerings of food, drinks, chromosomes and fancy clothes to the Dark Lord Chin-Chin.\n",
      "After watching Fullmetal Alchemist, I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. Everything felt rushed, and the twists and turns lacked gravitas. So it was with great scepticism that I continued on to watch Brotherhood. Quickly, my fears about this remake were dispelled and I was hooked. Four days and 64 episodes later, I'm at the end and I'm blown away.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I do strongly suggest you watch FMA before moving onto Brotherhood. FMA was good, had a lot of entertainment value, but half the things I wanted to see didn't happen - and I haven't even read the manga yet. But in Brotherhood you get everything you\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "expected to see and more.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The relationship between Edward and Alphonse feels so much more real in FMA Brotherhood. I can actually see their bond and believe that they'd do anything to get their bodies back. In FMA, I wanted to see more brotherly moments, and I just didn't get that until Brotherhood. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Winry had a much bigger role to play in Brotherhood than she did in FMA. Her interactions with Ed and Al we hilarious and touching, and the three of them really drive this story all the way. You never stop rooting for them and you never stop hoping that they can right their wrongs and get their bodies back.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another favourite duo was Mustang and Hawkeye. I loved seeing the two of them together, because they just played off each other really well. They were there for each other through thick and thin and every scene they had together was a delight to watch.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA Brotherhood left me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't stop watching, and when I had to because I needed sleep, I swear that all I could think about was FMA Brotherhood, the characters, and where I thought this anime would go. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I strongly recommend this!\n",
      "I really enjoyed this anime purely for the fact it always had me on the edge of my seat.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character development through the whole thing was absolutely amazing! seeing Al and Ed go through god only knows what all the while learning from their past experience was just mind blowing and partly one of the reasons why I really love this show. Side characters were even developed and honestly it was beautiful to see all the hard work of everyone in the FMA:B team just all fall into place mainly because of character development and an extremely gripping story line (with added side plots too\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "keep the story going)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation at first was not really my cup of *insert drink here* but slowly grew on me as I couldn't imagine the show being drawn in any other way.     \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack for the show was also one of the reasons I really enjoyed it as I'm normally one to skip intro's and outro's but the songs were just beautiful and fitting to be skipped, even after I'd heard them countless times, I still search for them on Youtube and listen to them now! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would highly recommend anyone to watch this anime even though it is lengthy but still so amazingly good!\n",
      "Anyone who does not like Deus Ex Machina and plot points that seem to be hastily shoved into place should not watch this Anime. And any fans of the original FMA Anime should tread carefully. While this is still a fairly good show there are many things that just don't work.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's always a shame to see good characters go to waste. Ed and Al are two interesting kids who will do no growing or learning over the course of 64 episodes, they began and end their journey the same as they started it albeit with a varying degree of limbs. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our story centers around a\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "generic good vs evil plot, where those that fall under the banner of evil show no real reasons or proper motivations for their actions aside from the authors needing a villain. Why do the homonculi want to help Father? Because a villain needs henchmen. Why does the Dwarf in the Flask want power? Because why not.  It's a shame the story is such lackluster since the world it's built in feels so vivid and inviting. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But even a greater shame then the villains would have to be the supporting cast of the good guys. Ed and Al don't develop or change but they are still interesting, the same can not be said for their companions. An odd medley of alchemists, soldiers, and chimera all fighting for the greater good and barely an interesting one among them. If you want to watch this series and find some good characterization, pay attention to Ling and Greed. They are the only characters that actually seem to grow, change, and have real conflict within this story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a final point I would like to say that while both FMA and FMA:B use death as a major driving force for characters FMA:B can almost be laughed at for even attempting this. Characters with no actual characterization are killed off and we are expected to see this as a shame and a reasonable excuse for a major characters actions. If your flashback scene for a character can only consist of \"Hello, I'm [Name].\" and two other boring statements with no real barring, then this character should never be used to develop major plot points.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Story-10\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) has an fantastic story. Its pacing at first is faster then I'd expect, since the '03 FMA's first few episodes were some of its most developing, but it quickly makes up for any lack of development later on in the show. It's also has the perfect length at 64 episodes, as if it were any shorter, I'd personally think it was a bit too short, and if it were any longer, too long. Everything is great, from the emotional beginning to the truly epic ending.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art-9\r\n",
      "FMA:B is animated gorgeously. Anything from its talking scenes, to\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "drama scenes, to action scenes, all look great.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound-9\r\n",
      "I'm going to get this out of the way right now: I loved every single one of these openings/endings. They were all great songs that fit the point of the show they were at. As for the OST, its still great, but I really sense that they used the same tracks over more times than I'd like.\r\n",
      "I watched FMA:B both subbed and dubbed, and I actually have to say that I like the dub more than the sub. Vic Mignogna  does a perfect job as Edward, and everyone else does great returning to their older Characters from FMA '03.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters-10 \r\n",
      "The characters is definitely one of FMA:B's strong suits in my opinion. You feel for every character, main or side, villain or hero. All characters are fleshed out and feel real. In two different episodes, you can see Edward actually grow taller, and that's TRUE character development.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment-10\r\n",
      "I truly love this anime. It made me laugh, smile, tear up, made me full adrenaline, and all at once sometimes. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime, and probably always will be. It truly deserves everyone's enjoyment.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall: 9.5/10\n",
      "Look, I can see why this anime is really loved, but I just don't think it's that good. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "No, this is not a troll, and I think it's silly that people might think I'm trolling simply because I don't like a show, but when it's the highest rated anime on the sight I can probably come to expect some hate. But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is just not that good. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "For one, the pacing is really messed up. In the first season (12 episodes) we jump from past to present and zoom through something I can tell was probably a really important part of the story,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "and it left me with no way of attaching myself to any of the characters. Several characters die and impact the story and the mains but it's so rushed that as a part of the audience I can't find it in myself to care, really. It seemed like they were plot devices. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing I think is bad is the way things are revealed. Without getting too much into spoilers, we're kept in the dark of a character's past until some part of the story like 40 episodes in, and then all of a sudden it's dropped on us and we're expected to get it. The anime also has a lot of \"philosophical\" undertones, I guess, but the philosophies are really weak and surface level. Such as Edward in the first few episodes when he's in that town and talks to the Rose character, telling her that humans can be made with ingredients found in the town market and that alchemists are atheistic because they know these things--but Edward has SEEN god. This, also, is conveyed after the fact, which just makes it even more confusing. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And really my biggest issue with the anime is that there seems to be an inconsequential bit of tension. IT's so repetitive. Ed and Al fall apart and we all know they'll just get put back together again The whole reason Ed has automail is so that it can get wrecked in the story so he seems to be in danger. Nothing ever comes of it! By the end all the characters are pretty much the same, no development has been done, but the show has a Disney ending anyway because, for some reason, a show with philosophical undertones needs to end happily. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation was really good, and I enjoyed fight scenes well enough, even if a power like alchemy is poorly explained. It looked good all the way through, and there's no character designs I dislike either, but they use the same music tracks over and over in the show and I started to get tired of the music overall. I will say this, though, the openings and endings are pretty top notch. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "So overall I didn't really like this show at all. My biggest thing is that I think this show has a high score because it came at a time that anime was booming, and it successfully adapted the source material in a way that the original failed to do. You know everyone says \"the book is better than the movie\" even when the movie was good? That's because, for some reason, people just think the thing that came first is better. So when a bad show is made from a bad manga, people think it's good because it stays faithful, but I don't like it. If you did, that's fine, but you have to remember that the philosophy is weak, the characters don't develop, and the ending is predictable.\n",
      "Let me start by saying this: This review is only helpful if you haven't seen the first FMA. Shocking, I know, but people like this do exist.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alright, I've seen 12 episodes of FMA Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) The animation is stellar, the action is gorgeous, and scene arrangement ensure a smooth, liquid pacing that ensures you're never bored.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) The music, the voice actors, everything is great. I can't review sound - go watch and listen!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) The characters are fantastic.  The only character I hate is Ed, shockingly enough.  I know, how can you enjoy a series and hate the main character? As far as I can\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "tell, Ed is the male equivalent of a Tsundere, meaning as they develop how he actually thinks and feels, I'll grow to love him.  I hope.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The other characters, and there are a lot of them, carry the show.  Someone is constantly looking to have something done or has some agenda, and characters with conflicting agendas manifest naturally.  This makes for a gorgeous multi-linked plot that is getting both hectic but staying steady and clear.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4) Story: FMA Brotherhood is a show about two brothers making a mistake and then trying to fix it.  At least, on the surface.  It becomes rapidly clear a whole lot of other things are going on, and these things will doubtless lead our intrepid heroes down down down the rabbit hole until we find ourselves at the heart of some crazy hair brained world reaching plot.  Or at least, that is my anticipation.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The brotherhood dynamic, as cited in the title, actually doesn't seem like the critical plot focus to me thus far.  It plays an integral role, and parts along the way are definitely fleshing it out, but the real enjoyment from the series lies in the varied assortment of individuals you are meeting along the way.  I've read some of the other reviews, and they state these characters aren't being fleshed out enough.  Given the fact that the series hasn't ended yet, I'm desperately hoping this is true!  Good story telling is done by slowly shaving down to the core of what characters are.  Imagine my surprise in Ep. 11 to discover Roy Mustang isn't secretly a bad guy, in spite of how he is originally portrayed, and how I originally perceived him to be.  At this critical moment for him, my feelings about him completely toggled over to one where, hey, I know exactly who this guy is, and I like him a lot more for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5) Enjoyment: The show makes me lose sleep waiting for it to come out to view.  That should indicate just how much I love it so far.  I will say this: As long as they keep the quick pace up and keep chipping away at the truth, Brotherhood will become a stellar classic, making people wonder why there was any doubt as to where it was going.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I compare its pacing, and plot advancement solely to Code Geass for how quick and consistent it runs.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "***I've just now obtained FMA (the original) and started to watch it, struggled through about 12 episodes, and threw in the towel. It was boring, Brotherhood has spoiled me.  I hope this doesn't offend original viewers, but all that other stuff in there is fluff to what Brotherhood is portraying as plot critical, and since my mind is full of Brotherhood thoughts, well...\n",
      "When the original Fullmetal Alchemist series released, it was praised as one of the greatest anime ever. This series wasn't created to replace that position, but as more people read the continuing manga version of the story, more people likely wished for an animated series featuring that original plot. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood seems to be that original story, yet I couldn't confirm it myself as I haven't read the manga and only watched the original series. Many people claim it a strong point that this is the original author's intended direction of the plot, and that may be true, but I would say this specific\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "adaptation of the manga is likely not a good representation of the manga's fame.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is now praised ahead of the original series and is treated as one of the best anime ever created. I would personally disagree with that point, but not to the extent of calling it bad. This version of Fullmetal Alchemist stands out as one of the most complex shounen tales I have ever witnessed, while still carrying many of the shounen cliches. It has a big budget behind it, despite holding a smaller viewer base on its televised premiere than the original, and that budget shows.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From mentioning budget, I'd first like to cover the audio and visuals of Brotherhood. The visuals are some of the best I've seen and you can really tell it was made by Bones. The show is overflowing with visual attentions to detail that stick between scene transitions, and you will very rarely notice something missing. There are a variety of locations with great levels of detail in their backgrounds, and the animation is always there to serve motion. Despite some of the animation being a bit wonky, the show holds a good amount of great action.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack leaves a bit more to be desired. While the tracks that do exist are very unique, there isn't enough variety in the tracks available to correctly display every emotion a story like Fullmetal Alchemist needs to convey. The original series had plenty of action-oriented tunes to play, but this version seems to only have about three available and you'll hear them in just about every fight. In a shounen, action-adventure you'd expect more of a priority in that type of soundtrack instead of quieter, less-memorable ones. The soundtrack isn't as orchestrated as the original, and the music sounds very electronic at times, but the soundtrack isn't bad in its own right.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a final note towards budget: The openings/endings of this show are generally above-average, but none really express a feeling of excitement or anticipation and are usually softer, not really catching the feeling of the series. The last ending song was the most memorable by the simple notion that it fit better with what was actually going on in the series at the time. Mentioning timing, it should also be noted that there is quite a lot of odd placements and cut-offs of music in Brotherhood, and there are close to a dozen times when it will even conflict with the emotions you should be having in the story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond budget, the \"true\" story of Fullmetal Alchemist is a long and imaginative one. With the length of the manga, I could safely assume that Brotherhood doesn't cover a large percentage of the manga's details. This is where things start to stumble from the potential this series had. In the original series of Fullmetal Alchemist, there was a variety of unconnected problems and issues to deal with that kept things interesting. In Brotherhood, however, the show puts all of its focus onto one, single plot-goal, barely ever straying from that goal. Making a series of over sixty episodes needs some variety or twists to keep things interesting, but Brotherhood severely lacks in that aspect.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first dozen episodes start with an almost episodic nature, speeding through content that correlates with the original series. That could be justified by this being a supplement to the original series, but that only makes Brotherhood less sturdy on its own feet in the process. The show strikes a point shortly where an interesting plot begins. Even at that point the entire outcome of that plot is very predictable, but it serves some intrigue through the encounters it creates. However, it soon begins to drag as characters begin to do less and plan more of how to get from point A to point B in order to head to their predictable destination. There are no twists in this time to bring another rise in interest and the show assumes that one plot is enough. What the original series did to combat that is take what is treated as a secondary plot in Brotherhood (the regaining of Ed and Al's bodies, which is learned at the beginning) and put more focus on it, bringing out more detail and development. Brotherhood even pushes that to the side and fuels itself off of character interaction between a growing list of non-developed characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood had two chances to fix this problem with the direction they chose to go. One solution could have been to make the series longer and make more side-plots and more development in other characters to make the viewers care more for them. That would also fix the huge pacing issue that can be seen in the beginning, and throughout most of the show. The second route they could've taken, still focusing on this one plot, is shortening the entire show to about half its length and cutting out unnecessary details.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instead, Brotherhood focuses on the technicalities of fixing a large, yet predictable, situation. Choosing that path could still bring some interest if the dialogue was top-notch, but it just isn't at that level in Brotherhood. The planning the characters do to solve obstacles in their path is generally interesting and somewhat smart with the fantasy elements it has in place, but the terminology most of the characters use (in the english dub at least) is generally simple and very particular. You'll be hearing a lot of simple and repeated phrases for describing situations, and that is a large amount of the dialogue. Character interactions don't delve too much within the pasts and minds of each character, and development is barely made. Even the main characters, Ed and Al, almost feel like side characters after the first dozen of rushed episodes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we have a problem with pacing, a lack of focus towards variety in story and plot, a lack of soundtrack elements to correctly display moods, and I may even say a lack of style. The presentation of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood feels more in tune to getting to the point and rushing the way there. It never takes the time to introduce the viewer to the story and practically acts like a slideshow of what happens here and thereafter. There's barely any clever camera angles or attentions to detail in a consistent and unique style like the original, but there are plenty of details in the technicalities of the leading plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have a great feeling that the story of the manga had great potential of creating one of the best animated series around, but this attempt just falls short on direction. While the technical aspects of the manga's main plot are likely in place, it seems the director and screenwriter forgot to take into account that they are translating the story to film, not treating the film as the manga. A manga and a show are two different things that have different opportunities to be unique. Although the director of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was involved in the creation of the acclaimed movie \"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", there's a reason that he worked solely on the storyboards.\n",
      "Regardless of what's going on this time around, after episode one I am convinced that this FMA is definitely worth the watch. The story seems to take place sometime before the first FMA, but it's really hard to tell.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From what I've gathered it's sticking really closely to the manga this time around. As for the overall awesomeness of the animation, its seriously a 10. The action and the fighting are great and the animation is smooth and amazing. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's interesting to see the voice of Urahara as Roy Mustang (one of my fav Bleach characters is ROY?! lol) and Ed and Alphonse are the same\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "as last time. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "So yeah, based on only seeing the first episode its definitely a must watch in my opinion, but this is coming from a hardcore fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist. ENJOY!\n",
      "I know that writing a review after only seeing 10 episodes isn't really fair. But I just thought I'd share my opinion on it. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "After watching and entirely loving Fullmetal Alchemist I decided to watch Brotherhood. The very first scene was entirely different, and this continued throughout the rest of the episodes that I watched. After coming from FMA, the change in character behaviour and attitude was a complete shock. I couldn't bring myself to watch the rest of the series out of fear of ruining FMA completely.\n",
      "Fascinating. When Bones announced Brotherhood, I was like ‘You want to sell us the same story again, huh? That’s really greedy, you bastards!’ Well, I still think that Bones did it for money. Of course they did, because that is how industry works. But after spending about half a year of my life on watching Brotherhood, I have to admit that this show is worth every single yen it will earn.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood is a ridiculous phenomenon to me. It subverted all my criteria for choosing anime to watch. I always preferred ranobe-based shows to manga-based, and I never liked long-runners. Y’see, my ideal was some 13-episode\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "bittersweet anime based on a sci-fi novel with some cute girls or something. That doesn’t resemble Brotherhood at all, right? But I cannot find a single clue to not liking the new Fullmetal Alchemist series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood’s plot is nearly flawless. (I still have some questions, but I always have them, so screw me.) The first anime was good, but it played out somewhere in the middle, when its plot overran the manga. There is no such problem in the second anime. Even more, its plot goes epic near the end. Well, the word ‘epic’ is not even enough here. If English had a single word for ‘oh god, so epically epic’, that would be a better choice. And plus the skilful character development… Elric brothers actually grew up throughout the series. And there are a lot more characters with their own individualities, y’know. Arakawa Hiromu-shi is damn genius in this field, no kidding. Call me a sexist, but I never thought that female mangaka can create a plot so twisted, exciting and based on pure logic. Like, remember that episode when… Oh, I can’t bring examples without spoiling something. Bad, but let’s better proceed to next aspect.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Only objective issue I can bring here is that the beginning was a bit fast, but that’s okay since Bones already covered that part of the story in the first show. However, if you didn’t watch that, you’ll find that first episodes of Brotherhood are somewhat rushed.\n",

It easily overwhelms the first one in terms of enjoyment. Hell, it may be the best shōnen show about the guys with superpowers that was ever made. Some people can dislike Brotherhood for its popularity or annoying fans, but every good series receive this kind of treatment. Y’know, fandom is fandom and anime is anime. It’s a bad thing to mix those up.\n",

      "Well, giving Brotherhood 10 points will make me sound like a fanboy, but jeez, I already sound like one and I’m okay with that. I can recommend it as an example of awesome shōnen series to all anime fans, from narutards to those carriers of eternal wisdom, who think that every show which has more than 100 fans is a hyped-up kuso for brainless masses. 10 points, that’s it.\n",

The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it.  Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it.  It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe.  The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly to\n",

The story was always keeping the 'watcher' wanting to keep watching no matter what.( I found myself staying up way later than I planned to keep watching this series) Every concept in this anime (Alchemy and Alkahestry) was simply fantastic learning about and watching it be used from creating giant flipping fists punching people in battle to saving peoples lives. Anyone who has watched this anime(or read the manga) probably agrees with me that they would give anything for our world to have Alchemy. And also,THERE ARE NO FILLERS, *laughs like\n",

Watching the magnificent view of the Resembool country side to every small detail of the tediously created alchemy circles to every fight scene; the breathtaking and epic animations were clearly shown in every episode. All the fights had more... oomph, than those in FMA. There was more fight and felt like you were actually there. They were more dramatic and more gruesome(gruesome being a good thing)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sound in FMA Brotherhood was fantastic as well. All the ending and beginning songs were spectacular.(as well as their animations) Much effort was put into every sound. The sound of a transmutation circle going off, the clapping of hands for Ed's alchemy, agonizing screams of people who loose limbs or are mortally wounded, well thought out speech for every character; they were all fantastic.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Characters were spectacular as well as everything else. Every Character was fabulous and played an important role for the overall story. The only problem I had involving characters was that the main antagonist's personality was boring. He didn't seem interesting enough. Another minor problem with one of the characters, I would have given anything for Sloth to say, \"What a drag.\" instead of, \"What a pain\" (if anyone got that reference)(hm, that may be considered copyright, I don't know)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment, damn right I enjoyed this anime. Without hesitation, I put it as my top and most favorite anime. Two other things I would like to point out that I also enjoyed about this anime. The great amount of suspension and action leading up to the Promise Day and how burly men.(in Brotherhood it's Major Armstrong and Sig Curtis, forgot who it is in FMA) There was I was literally crying from how funny it was, how they compete against each other with muscles and gain each others respect. Then see them handshake. One of my most favorite things about this anime. \n",

      "The first time I watched through FMA and FMA Brotherhood, I hated everything about Brotherhood but loved FMA. I don't know why. Rewatching both of them, I've found that I love Brotherhood a 100, no, a thousand times better than FMA. I hated the FMA ending but loved everything about Brotherhood. I don't know what I was thinking.\n",

      "Overall, I would recommend this to anyone, it's long enough where it's not as short as those 12 or 24 episode anime and then ends abruptly. FMA brotherhood has a pretty damn good ending(better than most), well I mean sure it could have gone on for another episode or two to explain some things *cough* *cough* Winry and that stuff. Anyways, if you watched FMA and wondering if you should watch Brotherhood, WATCH IT. If you've already watched both of them, I hope you agree with me that Brotherhood is superior, watch it again because it never gets old.\n",
      "This is one of the greatest anime's I have ever seen in my life. After watching this show more then three times it is truly perfect. Characters and character development is amazing. The story line has you thinking is one of the most original stories I have ever seen. The sound and openings are great. The art style fits the anime perfectly and it brings out the personality of the characters. Overall this is truly the greatest anime.\n",
      "Before I get started, I should say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime series and favorite television show in general. I prefer it over the first anime, but I did watch Brotherhood first which may bias that, though the ending of Brotherhood is definitely better and I really enjoy many of the characters that the first anime excluded.\n",

      "in some way, even if you don't know it will at first.

Ed becomes a state alchemist with title Fullmetal Alchemist which he uses to help his research as he and Alphonse travel around the country searching for leads. Along the way, they meet Homunculi (seeingly immortal beings named after the 7 deadly sins who are te main antagonists of the series), Scar (a man who seeks revenge on state alchemists for starting a war against his people and killing them), and friends like Ling (a prince from another country seeking imortality), and other state alchemists and officials who help him like Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\n",

      "The art in FMAB is exceptional and just as good in the beginning as it is in he end. The fight scenes are well designed and show an amazing amount of detail. The one thing to note is that this show has a large amount of blood (especially in the fights with the homunculi who can survive even if their bodies are cut in half many times). The sound goes along very well with tracks that fit the mood perfectly (my personal favorie being \"Pride's Theme,\" a very creepy song that fits Pride [a homunculus] very well).\n",

      "The characters in FMAB are some of the best. Edward Elric is my favorite anime character. Ed is a short, blonde boy who los his right arm and left leg which are now replaced with automail. He is the youngest state alchemist ever due to his abilit to transmute (the act of doing alchemy) without a transmuation circle (which he gained at the same timehe lost his arm an leg). Alphonse is Ed's younger brother whose soul resides in a large suit of armor which was the result of Ed's last-ditch effort to save his brother after failing t bring their mother back to life. Al is often mistaken for the Fullmetal Alchemist due to this which annoys Ed (plus Al's now taller than his shorter, older, brother). Winry Rockbell is Ed and Al's childhood friend and Ed's automail mechanic who created his leg and arm.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some of my other favorite characters are Envy (one of the homunculi who can shapeshift and disguise himself [his gender is never actually determined] which basially makes him the troll of this show), Roy Mustang (the Flame Alchemist who wants to become the military leader of the country in place of King Bradley one day and works with Ed and Al at times though Ed doesn't really like him much at first), Riz Hawkeye (the kin of woman who obliterates any stereoptypes about women, she is Mustang's most trustworthy soldier and helps protect him her badass-ness), Ling Yao (the prince from another country who seeks immortality, though saying much abou him would be a spoiler; accompanying Ling are Lan Fan and Fu who are his personal bodyguards and will lay their lives down to protect him [Lan Fan follows in Riza's badass, stereotype-destroying footsteps]), and Maes Hughes (a militaryman who loves his family, his friends, his family, being cheerful, and of course his faily [want to see a picture of his daughter?]).\n",

In all the anime was pretty good and was pretty interesting, but I don't get why it averages such high ratings. I prefer the sad ending of the first one, but the story had already fallen apart by that point. Brotherhood on the other hand knew exactly where it was going and attempted to get there at 10x the speed of the first one and with 1/3rd the character\n",

      "Believability: I would prefer Brotherhood's composition with the first one's story. I just didn't find it that believable. What can make a break a story's believability is the action scenes. Every single antagonist that they fought in Brotherhood should have won. The only fights that could conceivably end in a win were ones with Scar and the only reason I think that is because Scar is a bamf. The biggest hit to the believability of the story was everything to do with the main antagonist. Everything about him including how he lost is hard for me to believe and made it impossible for me to immerse myself in the story. If you care less about how believable the means are and care more about the results, then Brotherhood is great for you.\n",

There are no huge weaknesses to the other homunculi abilities and yet his is made inferior just by that fact of him being a homunculus? When I think about him I remember how Ed beat him in the first one. His armor had no real weakness, Ed just used his brain and made the armor not armor.\n",

      "-For those who have seen the anime and wonder what I found unbelievable about Father I have provided a few things below:\n",

      "Alchemy: How did Father not know about the foreign versions of Alchemy. He was made of the stuff in the first place. That simply makes no sense.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His Death: Talk about cliche... Ed fit into every single male protagonist cliche when he fought Father. Somehow a guy who can do above average Alchemy can beat a being made from the stuff, who can use alchemy with a thought? What!? One might make the argument that Father was out of energy during their fight. Well... isn't that convenient. He could have squashed them at any other time, but didn't because he correctly assumed they were nowhere close to his strength. It is the classic villain loses because of his own arrogance instead of any real actions taken by the heroes. It just seemed like the story could have simply been about Father and how he tried to become God and failed because it wasn't possible and have no mention of any of the main characters except to have them kick start his ritual.\n",
      "This anime is about two brothers fighting to regain their bodies after a alchemy experiment gone wrong. Along the way they uncover an evil plot and pick up many companions. \n",

      "Plot: Think of a very linear anime like Fist of the North Star, where Kenshiro travels from village to village, challenge to challenge, always moving forward, always exploding heads and never revisiting any of the places he’s conquered. FMA is the opposite. It actually reminded me of an RPG videogame the way the characters would travel back and forth between cities and how these locations would change between visits. For example, Edward goes from the\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Pacing: The series starts out doing a great job showing how characters get from point A to point B but then they get lazy. About halfway through the series characters start jumping between cities without proper explanation of how they got there. For some people it’s irrelevant but to me, it gives the impression that the characters simply teleported. I mean how does a little girl magically get from the frozen tundra of the north of the country’s eastern desert in between episodes? I’d like to know. Now do I want them to devote ½ of the series’ screen time to train rides? No. But it could have used smoother transitions.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also, By season 3 the cast gets large enough to where the episodes switch between 4-5 different character groups in different parts of the country. In theory this is good because it adds intricacy to the plot. The problem I have with FMA is that they will leave one storyline on a cliffhanger to switch to a relatively uneventful storyline. For example, they’ll leave Edward bleeding and half dead in a frozen wasteland just to switch to Al and Winry helping villagers build houses. It’s one thing if you follow Game of Throne’s style of switching from cliffhanger to cliffhanger but in this case I thought they could have cut out some of the fluff to make the story arc pacing a little smoother.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Action: I always like it when anime introduces a new fighting style. FMA does this with the addition of alchemy. The fight scenes are cool, creative and diverse. I also liked how even though Ed was a badass his friends didn't become useless or obsolete (aka like Goku's friends).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Comedy: This deserves its own section. Basically it’s pretty simple, if you like anime-style, slapstick, comedic moments you’re going to jizz yourself every almost episode if you don’t, you won’t stop rolling your eyes. There’s probably a Japanese term for it but it’s the comedy that involves fainting/nose bleeds after embarrassing moments, extreme facial distortions when angry, sleeping snot bubbles, huge skull blisters appearing after a friendly wrench beating. I found it a little much to be honest and it gave the anime a much lighter tone. Some people will love it though.\n",

      "Art: Good \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters: Great memorable characters with very vibrant personalities. I thought the concept of the homunculi was brilliant and their personalities, despite embodying single sins, were very complex and interesting—especially Greed, Wrath and Envy. Oh and Scar is one of the most badass antiheroes in anime. My only complaint is that they spent a LOT of time developing smaller side characters and not a lot of time killing them off. I mean yeah it’s good to develop support characters but by the end of the series the cast felt a little clunky. I mentioned this earlier but even in a 64 episode series you only have so much screen time. Instead of devoting time to exploring the thoughts, struggles and emotions of minor henchmen and tagalongs, why not spend it on the mains who are so much more interesting? Using the law of equivalent exchange, I would have liked FMA to transmute some side characters into more screen time for underdeveloped plots like Winry-Ed, backstories of Homunculi, Scar’s story, Father, etc. \r\n",
      "Overall: I am 90% satisfied. I think I would have been at 100% if this series could have been a little shorter or a lot longer. Basically if they had trimmed it down or spent the extra time to make everything complete. Everyone always raves about the ending but to be honest I still wanted more.\r\n",
      "Blood/Gore: It’s surprisingly bloody for a MA14+ anime. Severed limbs, bullet wounds, human sacrifice…mixed in with slapstick comedy.\r\n",
      "Love/Romance: Yes, there is a romantic subplot that develops very, very slowly over the series but it’s not the main focus. The “Action/Romance” genre is often attempted but seldom done well. It usually turns out to be an action anime w/ a clumsy love-interest side-plot or a sappy romance story with 2nd rate action. Either way the non-dominant side just becomes a plot device for the other one. Personally, I’m not really into sappy romance animes but I like it when a romantic subplot is done right and can make me care about a couple’s mutual survival in the context of a larger struggle (Mirai Nikki, Gosick). Anyway FMA does that well but I thought it could have been done better. \r\n",

I cheated a little bit and started off a bit into the story and discovered that lots of stuff was there that was not in the anime. So, I had to treck back to a point where this information started.

      "So, it's my assumption that this new series is going to follow in the true story of the FMA and the two brother's journey in their alchemy filled fantasy world. So far the story that is being told in the \"Brotherhood\" series is sticking pretty true to the manga. If this is true, please, take my advice, stay tuned. Especially if you were a good fan of the first series or just love a good anime with great plot twists and a great story line. whatever your interest, if my assumption is correct, which I'm 99.9% sure it is, you're all in for a real treat! =)\n",
      "Let me get one thing out of the way before I start this review: “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” blows its predecessor out of the water! Mind you, this is coming from a guy who found the original Fullmetal Alchemist a rather disappointing experience. That essentially means that I was skeptical when I first started watching this anime, only to be totally shocked by how good it was!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether you enjoyed the original, or hated it, this reincarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist has completely changed my opinion of the series as a whole!\n",

      "Story (10/10) – I cannot stress enough how much better the story of “Brotherhood” is than the\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "original. If you’re reading this review, you likely know that the original show deviated from the manga after a short while, and continued in a rather different direction. As manga tends so often to be, the story of the manga ends up being much stronger than what the creators of the original anime were able to come up with. “Brotherhood” follows the story of the manga quite closely, thus the anime never feels like filler, or just boring junk.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first fifteen episodes or so are very similar to about the first half of the original “Fullmetal Alchemist”. “Brotherhood” covers more story in less time, and doesn’t drag nearly like the original did. This is especially apparent in the beginning, where some parts that were already told in the original series were more or less skipped over to save time. Purists might squawk about this, but it was probably a wise idea, in light of time constraints.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you’ve seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist, then you’ll be familiar with the first major portions of the show. It may feel like a rehash for the first several episodes, but you’ll fairly quickly realize that the scale of what will eventually take place is much greater, and much more sinister than what the original Fullmetal Alchemist conveyed. The twists that Ed and Al are taken through are enough to leave you wanting more after each episode. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But enough rambling. If you’d like a synopsis, just look one up.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Art 10/10) – The art in this show is simply superb! Characters and scenery are drawn with careful detail, and they also achieve a sense of realism, which is somewhat necessary in a “Steam-Punk” world that could almost be America a century ago. The mix of realism, combined with the fantasy of Alchemy, creates for an interesting balance that not many animes can achieve. Additionally, the art is very smooth, with each movement flowing into the next seamlessly. There were a few instances where larger or more intricate drawings were done with computer animation. These scenes are slightly choppier than the rest of the anime, but you likely won’t notice unless you’re looking for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only gripe I had with the animation was early on in the show, where characters would burst into silly caricatures  when they were especially emotional about something. Most notably is Ed transforming to look like a praying mantis when someone calls him short. This made it seem like the show didn’t take itself very seriously at first, but such incidents gradually declined as the show progressed, and became rather scarce during the more serious parts of the show. I simply think the show would have benefitted from less outbursts of this nature early on. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Sound 9/10) – The voice acting in this show is some of the best you’ll hear. I was pleasantly relieved to hear that there were no annoying, shrill voices that anime can be guilty of at times. There weren’t any standout performances that I can think of, but each actor voiced their role marvelously.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that it sounded to me like some of the music had been recycled from the original Fullmetal Alchemist. The music fit the scenes very well, but I thought an update might have been helpful. Also, the music never really stuck out to me as being particularly awesome. It was good, but not quite deserving of a 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Characters 10/10) – It will be quite a struggle to keep my comments succinct on this topic! “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” shines brilliantly in this area! Never before have I grown so attached to such a diverse cast of characters. There were a number of characters that I wasn’t particularly attached to in the original series that I grew to love in “Brotherhood”.  The show does a brilliant job of making each character’s motivations easy to understand, yet complex enough that they aren’t totally flat.  It also has a way of forcing characters who were once enemies to work together when faced with a common enemy. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was especially impressed by how Ed and Al were so much easier to relate to in “Brotherhood”. I found myself much more emotionally attached to them, and had a much stronger desire to see them succeed. Al is much stronger and helps Ed fight much more often, which I also found to be a pleasant change of pace. I could name probably ten other characters who I grew attached to, yet wasn’t terribly fond of in the original series. “Brotherhood” also introduces a set of new characters that blend in perfectly with that cast that I was already familiar with. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The long and short of it is this: the cast of “Brotherhood” will draw you in and leave you eagerly watching their every move until the conclusion of the series.\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood is a straight up mediocre show. I came into this anime so excited. I would always hear people say \"its a masterpiece\" or \"its the best anime of all time.\" Its even the highest rated anime on mal. I was hyped up and ready to see what the show had to offer. However, I was immensely disappointed. This show is so overrated it is unbelievable. It is so corny and ridiculous I am convinced only children enjoy this show. During \"serious\" fight scenes there are always bursts of unfunny comedy that is just straight up cringey. There is no sense of suspense\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "or nothing that keeps you engaged in the story. The characters are lame (especially that annoying crybaby talking robot boy), the music is meh, the animation is decent for its time. But I mean wow this show is so corny and is obviously targeted towards little kids. Corny does not mean bad tho. However this anime tries to be serious and corny at the same time which just completely ruins the shows atmosphere. This is by no means a masterpiece and should not even be in the top 50. Attack on titan is 10 times better I cannot believe the amount of people that overrate this kids show.\n",
      "This review will be rather short.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is not bad in general, it is just awfully directed. The main reason which caused that I didn't enjoy this anime was pathetic humour which is ruining EVERY episode. For example, there is a situation where main characters are talking about something interesting, and unexpectedly something \"funny\" happens and main thread of their conversation (or even whole episode) is cutted, because \"funny\" situation is most important of course. It is happening in EVERY episode, sometimes few times. Yeah, that 'humour' destroyed the whole story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this is not the only reason of course. The next thing: main characters. They\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "are boring. Typical battle shounen scheme. There were a lot episodically characters which were much better and interesting than Erlic brothers and no.1 badass - Bradley King.\r\n",
      "I liked the whole idea of philosopher stones and homunculus thing (and their names taken from seven deadly sins)\r\n",
      "The plot story is way too episodic too.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art - I loved that backgrounds. Seriously, it was really well drawn. Animation was nice too. But in other side, almost all characters looked very bad and too simple.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound - voice actors were matched really good (as usual in anime). Of course I'm talking about original Japanese voices. Soundtrack is average, I don't like this type of soundtracks (symphonic ones, like from 'Murican blockbuster). It is boring as hell, I'm glad, that it is rather not usual in anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Summarizing,I felt like I was watching rather a generic USA movie (trust me, I've seen plenty of them in my life, I started watching anime, because I was bored as hell by hollywood crap) than actual anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA:B is yet another battle shounen, which are thousands. It is not bad anime, but in my opinin it doesn't deserve to be even in top 50. It would be much better, when it would be 50% shorter and without ALL that pathetic humour.\r\n",
      "I watched it, and probably in next year I will totally forget about it.\n",
      "Well i know about half the world right now is about to curse at me for writing this, but I don't care. . Now for my Take on the so called \"greatest anime of all time\". IMO its pretty damn mediocre. I had watched the original, and thought it ok. Now i had to watch this. Due to my personal dislike of filler i thought id like FMABH. Yet i was sorely disappointed. I tried to go in open minded hoping to enjoy. Yet, found myself bored, I mean very bored. Like watching Bakemonogatari bored. Nothing to me stands out in this show. One it\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "has my least favorite character of all time in it(ok possible there are othr worse characters). Yet people treat Elric as if he was the greatest character. Hes a very very bad character for the number of episodes(more anger from everyone). Let me ask you, why is he fighting? Hes, fighting  to get him and his brother's body back. Its not as if their was some injustice, someone who stole their body. Oh no it was their own foolishness and i didn't feel sorry. Hell i didn't feel sorry during the entire series, Huges dies? who gives a !@#$. it wasn't sad. he went down swinging and he had a family, but rly? Its not like Clannad, (i hate harems but this is sad) and possibly even grave of the fireflies. Those are  sad. Now what ill say it does right sometimes is animation. even though at first i loved the alchemy mechanics,(so cool) it got very repetitive. The fights were smooth, but them, like most of the series became repetitive and i fast forwarded through to get to some plot. Let me now say though some things are great the first op was so good and it got my hopes up. the art was beautiful, and some characters were actually good. such as Hoenhiem or Rath.  Sound such as swords were amazing a true shinning point. Yet in the end what rly killed me was the predictable ending. I was expecting an epic final fight or epic final plot tiwst true Stiens;Gate or Madoka style, yet it was just final bad guy standing there, and guys saying \"FIRE EVERYTHING\". Then bad guy just takes it like a bauws. I did like that he was in it for Knowledge, at least he had a viable reason unlike elric who just lost and arm and a leg,but with automail why even give a !@#$? FMABH to me this is the greatest overrated anime of our time. The people who have this a favorite should rly try to expand out a little, and if it is your fav. well im sorry my opinion greatly differs. To me FMBA is just \"good\" no where does it excel to me, and im glad im over with it. (excuse me while i watch something good like Mushishi or Gintama)\n",
      "There is not much more to say about this other than that it is THE masterpiece. This anime is perfect in all ways. The variety of characters and personalities developed throughout the characters are what put this show on the top. The light-hearted humorous scenes were well balanced with dark, vicious scenes to create an anime that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire anime. The plot behind the anime is superb along with the detailed fight scenes and lessons that characters learned as a result. Not to mention this anime also has a killer soundtrack and animation to go along with it.\n",

      "The only bad thing about the anime is that all other anime you watch after this will not even compare...\n",

      "WRONG.\n",

      "The new season itself (from the sole episode I've watched so far) can be completely separated from the much loved first season. The director basically clicked the restart button on the series and we are in for a new rollercoaster of madness. This season is rumored to be working closer to the mangas storyline so no confusing other world as we witnessed in the rather -interesting- FMA movie. \n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second adaptation of the full metal alchemist manga. The show presents two brothers embarking a journey with a simple goal of recovering their limbs/body. In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, a practice called alchemy is used to obtain something in exchange for something of equal value. Alchemy is very versatile in this sense as it used healing, fixing and even fighting. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal alchemist presents a very interesting and enjoyable unique story with each episode building up on one another. It is well paced and consistent with its overall goal. No episodes felt irrelevant to the plot which made every episode\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "worth watching. Its build up with each episode created a very satisfying ending with great twists and turns. It was unpredictable at times and had great action with the use of alchemy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters in Fullmetal Alchemist are very likeable with each character having an ulterior motive. The interactions with the cast provided great entertainment and depth. Character development of the cast was top notch with lots of memorable moments. There are many antagonists in the show with each being labelled as one of the deadly sins. Each one managed to live up to their name having different personalities and motives. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I was completely satisfied after watching Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood. It provided a great coherent story with characters that were very memorable. It receives a high re-watch value and recommendation.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood surpasses the original series in almost every aspect imaginable. After I had finished watching the original FMA, I felt a endless sense of dissatisfaction, as the ending didn't sit right with me at all. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'll be honest, i put off watching Brotherhood for a very long time, as i didn't think that a lot of the series would have changed dramatically. I expected a bit of enhanced animation and the addition of a few characters. God. I couldn't be more wrong. The remake shines a new light onto the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, improving all of the imperfections and errors that were in\n",

      "the original series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story line was healthy and straight to the point right from episode 1. No mucking about. As the plot goes on it gets hard to compare both series as the plot slowly drifts in difference directions from each other. What i was most enjoyed about was of-course, the ending. It was initiated perfectly, leaving no questions un-answered, which i feel was my main issue with Fullmetal Alchemist. It tied the entire show together neatly, the way it should have been.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation was beautiful. At times it was inconsistent, but even then it was great. Given that there is roughly a 6 year gap between the FMA and brotherhood, improved animation was a defiant. A lot more detail was provided though, which was a pleasant surprise.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ah, now for the sound. Masafumi Mima deserves a medal, because he completely nailed this. I don't think there was a single OP or ED that i didn't enjoy. It matched the concept of Fullmetal Alchemist and scenes so well. There is nothing to say other than it was amazing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters were developed a lot which was nice to see. It seemed there were at least a few episodes per main character to try to get to know them and deconstruct them as a character. This was a smart way to build the connection between viewer and character. Also bringing in a few new main characters that were not even mentioned in the original series was risky, but boy, it pull off. It gave a whole new feel to the show. With that being said, that squinty eyed guy sure knew how to annoy me at times.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall I am so glad i finally decided to watch Brotherhood. I ask for nothing else. I am more then content now hah. For everyone that has seen Fullmetal Alchemist and is thinking about watching Brotherhood but is worried it will be a waste of time because you think you already know what will happen. Go watch it, now. Stop reading this review and go watch it.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good show but to me it isn't as good as the original FMA.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main reason for this statement is the 'changes' in the story. I know this series supposedly follows the manga but that's probably my problem. I've seen some shonen anime and the plot usually isn't the best thing about it, especially the ending. I liked the mysteries and the logic in the first FMA better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't watch all the episodes in one go because I thought the first 14 episodes were really bad. Up untill those episodes the story is the same as the original and they probably\n",

      "rushed through it. Wasn't that part of the story 30 episodes long in FMA?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My third remark is the animation. I don't exactly know what's different ( I think they didn't use as many shadows) but the art seems worse, less dark which probably fits the shonen story better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can understand why a lot of people like this version of FMA better, it's probably because of the same reason why shonen anime are among the most popular, but I think some of the tragedy and consequences of equal trade that were present in the original FMA were lost in this series.\n",
      "I love watching Anime since my Childhood and this one is my list of my TOP ANIME that i've ever watched. The Story is very unique that i can never expected the Scenes, What i love is their Sacrifices of the Characters not only the Protagonist but the Extra and even some of Antagonist here, The Enjoyment and Fun i experience here is unforgetable, I remember when i watch this Series ALONE while holding a Snacks. (This is what i'm doing everytime i watch Anime.)  I'm not expert in Animation but i think it is good. Thank you.\n",
      "This is my all-time favourite anime, and most likely will forever stay that way. The protagonist Edward Elric is my all-time favourite anime character, he has such a deeply tragic backstory alongside his brother Alphonse, which got me really invested in him right away, he grows and and develops so much as a character throughout the course of the show, has such an entertaining and funny personality which doesn't make him look bland at any point, shares such incredibly strong character dynamics which several other important characters in the show the suffering and pain he endures throughout which makes his final happy and fulfilled ending\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "incredibly satisfactory narrative wise. The show as a whole has such an amazingly compact storytelling, such a grand cast consisting of a wide range of wonderfully written characters in terms of characterization, great world building which is evident by how plot thickens and thickens towards as the story reaches its end, resulting in an epic, memorable and satisfactory climax which gives a proper closure to the story and the characters. The show via the rule of \"Equivalent Exchange\" actually heavily explores the fundamentals of karmic justice, which makes everything that happens feel grounded in morality. No other show has made me so deeply feel and care for the characters even again, I can give this a 1000/10 if I could. :)\n",
      "I recently finished watching this after seeing it at the top of the charts and learning that it had been at the top for a while. I can't say I'm surprised at this. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, or FMA:B, exceeded the expectations that I had for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: 10/10\r\n",
      "This is probably the thing that FMA:B does the best. The plot is engaging, and progresses at a reasonable pace. I have seen many people saying that this anime does not do a good job adapting the beginning of the manga with the first 14 or so episodes, but as a person who has not read the manga, I\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "think that the first 14 episodes are still very good. They are completely outshined by the remaining 50 episodes, but nonetheless still enjoyable. When it comes to the pacing, I also appreciate that this anime focuses more on the plot than on the fights, like how many other popular shounen like Naruto do. When the pace of the fights gets to Naruto levels, despite how good the story may be, it can feel unbearable to me at times to keep watching. The plot twists are reveals in Brotherhood are also executed quite impressively.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art: 8/10\r\n",
      "FMA:B's art/animation isn't bad, but it's not what brought it to the top of the charts either. In the first few episodes, it looked a little bit lackluster. I don't know if this is just because the technology in 2009 wasn't as good, they didn't work as hard here because they already did with the 2003 adaptation, or simply that I got used to it. Regardless, later on, the show's animation does look to generally improve, and when it tries to, it can look CLEAN, especially in some scenes when Roy Mustang goes ham. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound: 7/10\r\n",
      "I didn't pay conscious attention to FMA:B's sound effects, but I never thought anything sounded off while watching this. I watched and recommend the dub because it fits the setting better than Japanese speech. Seriously, these characters have the whitest names ever. Also, the Amestrian characters' writing is done in English. The cast of the dub voices do a fantastic job. The only minor complaint I have is that initially, Edward's English voice is a bit grating and can take a second to get used to. But in the comedic scenes, his voice is excellent. I love all of the OPs and EDs in this anime, But I do have to point out a flaw with the OST. First off, it's not outstanding like a Hiroyuki Sawano work. More importantly, some of the tracks just don't fit the setting. FMA:B takes place in what seems to be based on Europe in the early 20th century, but some of the soundtrack sounds like music from the medieval period. If I listened to some of this music without knowing what anime it's from, I'd assume it's from something like Seven Deadly Sins.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character: 10/10\r\n",
      "FMA:B has one of my favorite casts of characters, and in my opinion is only surpassed by one other anime that I have seen. There's not much for me to say here, but I liked every character and I had trouble picking a favorite. Edward is an amazing shounen protagonist, but my favorite character is Scar, who I think is criminally underrated. The Homunculi, especially Wrath, are fantastic villains.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment: 9/10\r\n",
      "The only issue I had that halted my enjoyment for a second was that in the middle of the story, all of the characters start going to and being in different places, and it can become difficult to remember who is where and why. But even without knowing the details at the moment, I still enjoy the hell out of FMA:B. These episodes could spend an opening minute or two on some recap, but the Internet and a quick Google search could take care of this problem anyway. Other than this, I have no gripes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall: 9/10\r\n",
      "Perfection doesn't exist, but FMA: Brotherhood does come pretty close. That doesn't mean it's the best anime, or even that it's my favorite. What I mean is that there is something in this that can be enjoyed by everyone. The plot is engaging, the characters are all likeable and/or relatable, there are fights but not enough to destroy the show's pacing, there is not too much violence or gore, there are cute ships and hints of romance, there are minimal amounts of fanservice if any, there is clean art/fluid animation, and there is good music. I strongly recommend watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood if you haven't already.\n",

      "Thanks for reading my first ever MAL review!\n",
      "Ehh...I loved the first Fullmetal Alchemist, but what I've seen so far of Brotherhood...sorry but I don't really like what they've done with the characters. The art style is...well, sort of like pokemon in my opinion and so not in a good way. I understand that some people might want the series to follow the manga a lot closer, but I thought it was fine the way it was in the original. I feel like they're doing more damage than good with this series.\n",
      "Jesus where do I begin,\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all, the story is NOT the incredible masterpiece everybody claims it is. The characters are shallow and filled with tropes and gags that are repeated CONSTANTLY. The art is ok I guess but none of the fight scenes that are promised in the openings actually seem to happen in the show itself, and besides the occasional flashy 5 seconds at the end of a fight there isn't much happening in the fight scenes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story feels incredibly rushed at times, which is strange considering that this was studio Bones' second attempt at this show. The sound is the best part\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "of the show honestly as the sound effects are perfect, the voice acting is stellar, and the op and end themes are all bangers.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall I'm giving this show a 1 because not only is it seriously overrated; but it's also just not very good at all.\n",
      "The art and action scenes are great. The writing is terrible and the \"expansion pack\" of characters (saying this having watched the 2003 anime) is annoying.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some side characters are too dramatic and have more story than they need to, well other more important characters lack story and depth. With really got me with the comparison between a certain character's death scene. In the first anime he's happening slow motion and there are flashbacks, and another character sees them again, and it's powerful how this character effected the other characters. It's beautiful. It's art. I cry everytime. In the second anime that character just dies. The\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a pretty beloved show on MAL and within the anime scene in general.  Personally, while I enjoyed it, I don't necessarily think it is the best thing since sliced bread.  It kept me entertained, and even at times made me feel an emotion or two, but the slow start and sometimes dragging plot didn't necessarily keep me thinking about watching the next episode when I was busy with other activities.  That being said, it is certainly worth a watch through at least once if you have the stomach for a 60+ episode series!  Let's get into the\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "breakdown.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story (8/10) - I think the story was fairly well done.  It wasn't groundbreaking and it didn't necessarily have a lot of \"oh snap!\" moments, but it executed quite well.  Its exposition was usually laser focused on the characters and history that mattered, the plot was consistently moved forward to the inevitable conclusion, and you did get a sense of something grander going on.  It didn't waste your time with a ton of filler, and you could see this spiderweb of deception in every corner of the world.  The events were logical, believable, and often relateable despite being set in a fantastical world of magic, with problems often mirroring very real life scenarios.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It also handled flashbacks remarkably well I think.  Many shows just drag flashbacks on and on.  FMA:B kept them quick and relevant.  It actually made me enjoy them and made me curious about the backstory rather than beating me over the head with historical exposition to justify everything.  My only real complaint with the story was how it dragged at the beginning while it was setting up the spider-webbing for the over-arching grand scheme.  It took nearly 20 episodes to get going, but once it did get going, it took off at a brisk run.  It was a significant enough annoyance to me though that I can't give the story a 9 despite its pretty quality execution.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art (7/10) - The art was certainly above average, but it didn't really stand out in any particular way to me.  It was consistently solid, with no mistakes, but not beautiful.  It served its purpose and allowed you to immerse yourself in the world, but was short of being truly captivating.  There were definitely brief moments where it came close to being stunning though, and I have to give credit for the very eye-catching design of Pride (hah, I made a funny!).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound (5/10) - I think the sound for this show was its weakest quality.  It felt to me like it was merely adequate.  It served its purpose, but nothing really was memorable to me from the soundtrack to the voicing.  My personal taste may be heavily colouring my opinion here, but I really just found the sound as action-average as any J-Pop intro to a RomCom or Ecchi.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters (8/10) - Along with the story, the characters were quite well handled.  They were all very standard stereotypes, but each had their own unique quirks and motivations to keep them interesting.  I wouldn't say any were particularly deep, but there were certainly moments where I would feel for a couple characters.  I enjoyed learning about all their backstories, and I enjoyed that they all walked their own paths, or at least tried to until they were often drawn back together by fate.  Their independence was actually relateable instead of the usual excessive aloofness of \"independent\" characters in many other shows.  They genuinely felt like individuals rather than cogs in a big machine.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment (7/10) - At my first foray into this series, I honestly have to say I was pretty \"meh\" about it.  Up until about episode 18 for me, the story dragged along as it tried to set everything up and introduce all the main players.  It sagged under the weight of it and I often found myself thinking of other things I could be doing while watching.   It was still enjoyable... just not really compelling.  Starting out this was a 5/10 for me.  After episode 18 though, the show finally kicked it into gear and I found my enjoyment increased *measurably*.  Middle of the show it was a 6/10 and by the end it landed a 7.  It's worth watching if you can make it to the end, especially considering the pleasant and fulfilling ending that so many action anime lack these days.  If I was my younger self, I could see myself having enjoyed it even more.  I can't say I'll rewatch it, by I'm certainly glad I've seen it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So overall I give \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" a 7/10.  It was almost an 8, but not quite.  Not because it did anything wrong, but more that it didn't try to push itself at all and stayed in its comfort-zone.  The story was interesting enough though and the characters did often elicit some compassion from me.  If you're reading this to figure out if you should watch this show, then sure, you'll probably find something in it worth your time (as long as you are good with 60+ episodes), but be careful not to go into it with too much hype in mind.\n",
      "Man, I was really late to the party on this one. Every time I saw polls on the best anime shows released, this would be usually top 5, maybe top 3. I remember hearing people talking about this when I was still in school, the type of people who didn't like anime telling me \"yeah, it's pretty good\". After about 6 years of hearing about it, and doubting it, I finally gave it a shot. Holy crap, why didn't I listen to everybody before?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went into this knowing nothing about the premise, so the show itself had to tell me how everything worked and keep\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "me interested enough to last something like 64 episodes. 64?! My sweet spot is 26, anything beyond that are a commitment I'm not willing to make.\r\n",
      "The first episode was one of the best pilots I think I've ever seen, it established so many world rules and characters and really showed off the budget and animation levels I was in store for. I remember thinking \"Woah, this really feels like Avatar: The Last Airbender\" and I grew up with that. As soon as I felt that, I knew I could last 64 episodes easy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show is relatively simple, there's a form of magic called alchemy that few possess, and there are large territories that are on very poor terms with one another. You're looking at great warriors and really detailed fight scenes. The real heart of this show is the strength of the characters, main and supporting, and the overall arcing story. It deals so well with escalation, never skipping too far ahead too fast as to lose you, but it keeps a quick pace with a lot of well explained mystery that you want to know more. Each section of the story adds foundations to the parts to come, previous pieces of intrigue combine to solve a larger piece of the puzzle. This feels so satisfying to watch, be it discovering the rules of alchemy to who the villain is and what his evil plan becomes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This show can become beautifully dark, from familial deaths of main cast members, to examining how far someone will go for perfection, justice, or even life itself. The villains are wonderfully metaphorical, each being charismatic and deadly, while the heroes are very complex and quite human. Fullmetal really dissects human nature and shows you both the best and the worse of it. What pins this down is a really great soundtrack, the whole thing creates this sort of feeling that just flows into you. You name it, this show probably has it: political instability and invasions, insightful character development across the board, a good sense of humour to lighten the mood just enough that the shocking moments hurt so much worse, amazing fight choreography, a well written love story, mysterious secret societies, redemption arcs for desperate thugs...   It really has so much to offer, each piece well rounded and ready to be enjoyed. I don't know how they fit in so much without it feeling overly complicated or too stuffed, but they did!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was an idiot for not checking out this show when people told me about it, because it really is a near perfect piece of entertainment across the board. By the end, I wanted more than 64 episodes, something I never imagined happening. I can't recommend this show more, it's unmissable.\n",

      "At first i was actually reluctant to watch brotherhood simply because i felt they were down playing how good original was. So pure stubbiness kept this wonderful experience from me, but could you blame me? There was a lot of hype about brotherhood, and to me the selling point was that it was a different ending to the same story i loved, but i later released that is far too understated of what the differences\n",

      "really are.\r\n",
      "So i finally decided to watch it after a saw the first episode on t.v. and i agreed it was a much better looking anime than original and the fact that it was still the same characters i loved, so why not see the difference. So off i went and ask my older brother for his copy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once it started i noticed immediately this anime was created for the original fan base and not an alternative to original, which ups its appeal for me. All the beginning story lines are fast passed so u don't feel your just sitting through original again, plus there are surprising changes(which i shall not spoil); so if u haven't seen original it can be a bit full on and \"a lot of info in a short time\" (as my friend who i showed brotherhood too, who hadn't seen original said) but its not impossible. i still maintain to this day too see both!\r\n",
      "Anyway, as the story progresses and you feel all secure knowing what's happening and (u think) you know where this is all going, until BANG! CURVE BALL, and suddenly your whisked away onto a totally amazing story completely different to original. These anime's stand alone! So it doesn't really matter which u start with or if u choose to just watch one (which is a same), but this said Brotherhood is better. And here's why:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well for one big point : Winry.\r\n",
      "HOLY CRAP that annoyed me in original, and my brothers can vogue that my first sentence once the movie that finishes original's story ends i seriously was like \"Ummmm wtf about Winry?! They seriously (spoiler)  just leave her!!\" and i think i cried but that doesn't matter.... \r\n",
      "In brotherhood not only do u see a lot more of Winry, you get a BACK STORY, AND DEVELOPMENT! HOLLY SHIT! And its very good. In original it was always left up to inturprritaion as too what Winry was to the Elric brothers, but now we get to see her story pan out and its supper well done.^_^. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another reason as to why Brotherhood is better than original is : The GATE/GOD/THINGY\r\n",
      "This part of the anime makes so much more sense and doesn't make me want to brake open my skull and pull out my brain. That's not saying original did amazing with what they had, i just think brotherhood doesn't stretch belief as unbelievably. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also the previous fact leads to my last reason : THE MOTHER FUCKING BEST.ENDING.EVER!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When original ended there was no sense of happily ever after. It just left off (spoiler) with that sense of the unknown, a guaranty that the story wasn't in fact over and a great big SQUID! ALL THAT SUFFERING AND THAT GREAT BIG, LONG JOURNEY AND YOU DON'T GET ANY RESOLUTION! That always bugged me but i could forgive original cause the journey was in fact amazing and i really love the beginning. But with Brotherhood, there was none of that. You know exactly were the characters stand at the end and everything is tied up with a beautiful bow! (SPOILER, not to mention babies!!! So cutttteeeeee! XD )\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So now that i've said all this before you watch brotherhood, i still suggest watching original first. I am one of though's people who saves the best parts of her food for last, or how i really think about it, end on the best flavour :) \r\n",
      "Original is longer too, so i feel you really can bound with the characters before starting Brotherhood, which makes the ending all the more satisfying! \r\n",
      "(You don't have to by any means, i just think its the best way to experience FMA)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So here's my rating for this anime:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: 10/10 a wonderful beginning, middle and end. Plus it flows organically, and you're never bored. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art: 9/10 Fluid, better defined colours and breath taking action. All the characters look better\n",
      "This is a short review of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I have seen many of the episodes, but not all of them in order and do not consider this a proper judgement of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story - 4: The story of Full Metal Alchemist is supposed to be about two tragic brothers going to search for the Philosopher's Stone that their father disappeared looking for. The laws of equivalent exchange are supposed to be really gruesome. Going out into the world and making discoveries is something really important to the Elric brothers. This impression was what made me love Full Metal Alchemist in the 2003 version.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "In Brotherhood, you do not get a big sense of any of this happening with the main characters because the first episodes that deal with these issues are terrible. They did this to save time, but it does not make sense considering that the beginning of an adventure is always the most important part to immersing yourself in the world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oddly enough, the majority of Brotherhood is based in creating its world while it somehow feels like just adding China to the equation made it a lot bigger. The oriental theme always feels disconnected from world-building and this was the same with Brotherhood even though it was detailed greatly and central to our two Asian characters. Ling was almost a decent character. It is definitely easy to like him, but his rather flat and plain character was simply hidden behind emotional storytelling cliches.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "War seems far too encompassing in the story. It seems too mundane compared to what we should expect with alchemy. There are so few alchemy users that it is ridiculous and they do not know how to use their alchemy in new ways most of the time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Toward the final battles of the series, everyone seems shallow and it would have been fine for most of the characters to die.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art - 5: The art is good mainly because it is grounded in proper details and good lighting and such. The colors are done almost true to reality, which they were going for. The characters usually do not take up as much of the screen as your average anime and I felt that it was both effective and alienating. At worst, the environments are a bunch of empty, hallway-like rooms and darkness in much of the later parts of the anime. Cannon firing is over-used to make things look exciting. Expositions and waiting scenes are very common to allow for more cheaper art.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is also the stupid rectangle effect with things getting obliterated or disappearing. It is quite detailed, but also not effective to conveying anything. Another annoying effect is Edward's alchemy, which is always spraying electricity and gray pillars rising out of the ground.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the openings, the art was always annoyingly cliche-looking and it did not vary between seasons. Not only were they animated in an annoying or stereotypical way, but they conceptually did not form any good themes. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first ending almost worked. The drawings were done nicely, but it thematically was pretty stupid to show as a children's drawing because no kid would think to draw these things except the Megaman-esque platform jumping part. The other endings were drawn very annoyingly, much more so than the openings.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound - 4: People love stupid orchestral music. A lot of this music was made to stay in the background and it sounds very dull and monochromatic. I honestly thought that there might have been only 6 songs. There actually are probably six songs they reuse in every episode because I remember getting really annoyed at hearing a few songs that were supposed to be sinister, but just sounded idiotically simple. The music department was just bare bones.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it comes to the openings and endings, some of them could be considered the worst of all anime, but nobody would admit that. They all sound like Bleach or Naruto songs, but without half as many strong points. Anyway, \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the sound effects, they are rather comprehensive. I would have rated the sound a 2 if the sound effects were just average, but they are definitely a step above almost any anime out there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character - 4: The characters are not explored enough to give you a sense of attachment. It feels like the war is the entire story most of the time. However, the developed characters are amazing. The villains are pretty terrible. This new (or orignail) rendition of Scar was one of the few awful protagonists compared to the 2003 anime. There is also Alphonse, who supposed to made deeper just because he finds a love interest. And, Edward is just a hopeless character. He has the same personality almost the whole time despite any supposed developments. This is mainly because the comedy feels like the only time Al and Ed could have shown what their personalities are, but everyone knows how bad the comedy is here. They are simply mired in conflict after conflict without being able to loosen up in a genuine way.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of the sins are pretty bad, even Greed and Envy who get the most development. They pretty much fight and do not represent themselves with their simple to write personality traits. All that defines them as characters is combat skills and maybe some grief over what they have been doing. The Father is without character except in his background. He is pretty much a stereotypical bad guy. The somewhat tragic past of Alphonse and Edward seems to be the only thing that is supposed to carry deep negative emotion in this show, and they blew that part of the story off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The voice actors are mismatched, making characters sound too stereotypical or too gruff (the Colonel definitely sounds too gruff) or just stupid (Lang and Greed to name two). However, I am basing it on an English dub and it is hard to really judge on voice acting because the Japanese could be loads better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment - 7: Despite many, many faults, it is possible to get engaged in this show and love it to some extent. Unlike other shows where you might compromise your beliefs and see bad aspects as good, you are prone to gloss over the bad aspects of this show because it is very enjoyable at times. As mentioned earlier, the storytelling can beat out the bland characters, which is very much like a movie. Despite the anime openings being weak and extremely generic, they are action-packed enough that you will be bound to enjoy them.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, there is still the terrible comedy which always falls flat (and would even without so much repetition of the same junk). There are still lengthy scenes that seem to be going over the same details again or showing seemingly the same scenes you saw in other flashbacks and expositions. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall - 5: I wish it could be lower considering how annoyed I was by this show.\n",
      "Cartoon Network isn’t what it used to be. As a kid, I watched CN because it had shows that appealed to tons of people, shows that had meaning, and shows that deserved to be labeled classics.

      "various anime are featured, and one of them used to be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I never liked Brotherhood; I love it. An avid reader of the FMA manga, I stumbled upon Brotherhood on Toonami and, form there, I was hooked. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime’s protagonist, the famed “Fullmetal Alchemist” whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward’s mediator during Ed’s explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn’t focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There’s Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There’s Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime’s most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening’s singer. Plotwise, there isn’t a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.\n",
      "Well, this is my first review so please tell me if you found this helpful or not so I can do a better one the next time :)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I heard about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood from a friend of mine and I really postponed watching this show... At this moment I feel like an idiot. This show was a masterpiece in all the directions it could and after finishing it I was completely astonished !\n",

      "Story (10/10) \n",
      "\r\n",
      "OK, at the first 2 or 3 episodes I was a bit confused and couldn't understand some things, but at the fourth episode I started to get what this amazing anime\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "was about.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it is said on the synopsis, it is about the Elric brothers trying to get back their bodies, after commiting the taboo of alchemy, trying to revive the dead using it. After failing and paying a heavy bill for even trying, with the older brother, Edward, losing limbs and the younger one, Alphonse, losing all his body, only for Edward to affix his soul into an armor, the story begins as Edward Elric, the older brother, becomes a State Alchemist, one who uses his alchemy for the military, in order to have a better chance of recovering their bodies. In the 3rd episode it's revealed that they are searching for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, wich is used for ignoring the basic rule of alchemy, the equivalent exchange. \r\n",
      "Now let me tell you that this isn't the real story behind Fullmetal Alchemist. The recover of their bodies comes at the second place of this anime, cause there are some more important things to take care first... the safety of the world for example...\r\n",
      "This was a more detailed synopsis and a better one I think. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now let's move on to what I liked about the story. It is really a mind-blowing one, as the events that happened before the story started are mixed with the actual story. That combination will completely shock everybody. There are a few very important characters, everyone with his own story, amazingly explained and included in only one amazing storyline. The Elric brothers story, the Ishbal's Civil War story and the very dark story behind some unthinkable things will amaze you, but not only these, as there are some other very positive things about the story:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- The plot and it's develop is uncomparable to any another anime I've seen;\r\n",
      "- It is very unpredictable and will surprise you every now and then;\r\n",
      "- It has some unforgettable funny moments, although being quite a dark anime\r\n",
      "- It has some very dramatic moments that will stay in your mind for a good amount of time;\r\n",
      "- The battles are fantastic, very strategic and enjoyable.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there is also a negative side. Due to the rushed start, a death of somebody at the first 10 episodes that is a turning point in the story, didn't look that dramatic as it should have looked, but at the latter stages of the show, you'll understand the significance of that person's death.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a certain point I thought that the end of this anime would ruin all, like Naruto's one, when that happy, unrealistic ending destroyed it. Luckily I was wrong, as the end not even was unfrogettable, but also at that point of the story nothing came for cheap.\n",

      "Art (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a newly made anime, unlike the version of 2003, the art is breathtaking. There is a memorable animation quality, that we even now, in 2015, do not often see. The animation in the fight scenes is amazing and very fluid. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character's design is very good too, as they are completely different from each-other. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think 'Bones' has turned this anime into a piece of art. Even the details of every character, that I greatly observe, are just fascinating.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The colours are great too, as I enjoyed very much the contrast between the bright and dark colours.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound (9/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To start with, I watched the subbed version, as I enjoy very much the japanese language. I didn' regret my choice.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character's voices and their intonation was really class. This was largely due to the elite actors they hired for doing this job. But even the ones that want a dubbed version won't have problems, cause I happened to watch one episode in the dubbed version and it was nearly as good as the subbed version.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first three openings were very addictive and I quite liked them. The other 2 openings were good too. The endings were great too, especially the fourth one.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the OST, there were some really fantastic ones for the tense, anxious and fight moments. Even the quiter ones were good and were played at the right moments.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only problem is that there is a lack of character's theme, even if there are some kind of instrumental music. That's the only reason that I'll give it a 9.\n",

      "Character (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters of this anime are all very interesting and entertaining and they all have a bond with each-other in some way. They all have different powers as well as their own ambitions and to not forget, a dark past...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we know the protagonists are the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric. Edward, also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist, or also as the youngest State Alchemist at only 15. He is stubborn, strong willed guy, leading the Führer President, the highest ranked person of the country, to code-name him Fullmetal. Alphonse Elric, the youngest brother, has a more calm and kind-hearted character than his brother. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this show wouldn't have been a masterpiece if there weren't some absolutely cool guys supporting them. I will write down some characters that are worth watching with details:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Colonel Roy Mustang, Edward's superior at the military, is a cool,  a bit arrogant (like Fullmetal) and good-looking guy, whose ambition is to become the Führer President. He is presumably the strongest State Alchemist. In addition, he has some amazing, very reliable and funny subordinates, who make this show a damn comedy at times with the way they do things. Man, that's what I call teamwork! You should definitely take a good look at them. Roy also cares very much for his subordinates and protects them with everything he can. Have a good look at Maes Hughes, Riza Hawkeye and his other subordinates cause you're going to love them. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "- The Elric's brothers father, Van Hohenheim, abandoned his family when his kids were at a very young age. In the first episodes when he makes short appearances, he looks like a cold guy, but it turns out to be different, even though he has a very dark secret in his heart...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Mey Chang and Ling Yao have comed from the East in order to obtain the secret of immortality for their Emperor with the sole purpose of gaining his trust and saving their clans. Mey Chang and Ling Yao are enemies and their battle for gaining the secret is worth a good watching.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Solf J. Kimblee is a hero of the Ishbalan Extermination Civil War and on the first episodes frequently makes short appearences in a prison, with wood handcuffs and with two transmutation circles in his hands. Well, what can I say, he is a complete psychopath, but I really liked how the heck he acted during the show. Did I forget to tell you that he was prisoned cause he refused to give the army a Philosopher's Stone they gave him to exterminate the Ishbalans and that he ate it? Oh yes I forgot, sorry.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- The antagonists in this show are all really badass, all immortal, very strong and part of the same \"group\". In that \"group\" are also 2 characters that I was completely shocked . That's as far as I'm allowed to tell you without spoiling everything, but they also have a very dark story and a very strange and sometimes confusing past.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character's development makes this anime even better than first thought. Again a big 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment (10/10) \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I enjoyed this anime from the start till the end in the same manner. If you don't like it at the first few episodes don't drop it, just give it more time, cause I'm sure you'll love it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is very important to watch all the details carefully, cause it can confuse you sometimes if you don't watch it properly. Furthermore, it starts giving you clues of what's going on behind the scenes from the first episode !!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, what can I say, I love this anime, so the enjoyment is 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I said, I was a bit suspicious about this anime at the start, but I think I did the best thing when I started it. It's absolutely a fantastic anime that I'm sure everybody will enjoy !\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thank you for reading this review and I'm going to finish it with a quote from the protagonist, Edward Elric:\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the impressive qualities from the first series and simply polished them. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art. The misplaced comedy was removed. Nearly no scenes which are intended to be dramatic are accompanied by slapstick humor. Brotherhood‘s visuals are of a considerably higher caliber and so are its action scenes. What truly separates FMA: Brotherhood from its original counterpart however is the way in which it explores profound philosophical themes. The level of depth in Brotherhood‘s story is astounding. It avoids any form of\n",

      "First I have to say that I'm an avid animanga goer. I have seen quite some series with different genres, and I also have other favorite titles. But among all of those favorite titles of mine, FMA:B stands gallantly, as it was the only one with such intelligence and perfection I was completely at loss for words when finishing it.\n",

      "original bodies back. Everything -- and by everything I mean from their backstories, the little arc, the wonderful climax and the satisfying conclusion -- is very well-thought, well-done. Everything about the alchemy thing and the (minor spoilers maybe) Homunculus thing, they completely blew my mind. The story was so brilliant and even though it started off with so many questions and so many confusions, the expanding story and the resolution answered them all for us. This story is what I would call, smart. It is complex, but not insane. The way we gradually understand the things happening inside the FMA:B universe is thanks to this anime's gratifying explanations. We are not too dumb to understand the story, and we aren't that smart to guess where the story is going either. All the ideas are very wonderful and magnificent. You don't usually find something this clever in an anime series...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As an additional note, I really loved the ending. It was totally 11 out of 10. No spoilers from me, though.\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sound - WELL WELL. I have the entire opening & ending songs. From again until Rain. From Uso until Ray of Shine. I have the entire anime soundtracks, composed by the brilliant Senju Akira, the three discs of magnificence. I listen to them over and over again. I have to tell you the sound is very diverse and beautiful. The voice actors and actresses are also brilliant. Romi Paku, oh gosh, you guys know how well she voices people. Ed is no exception. The sound effects, voice acting, BGMs, and opening-ending themes are all beautiful, what else to say man?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character - There are a lot of characters here. From our main characters to the enemies. The 'gray' characters as it was initially unclear where they belonged with. Suspicions and betrayals, enemies who turn allies. These characters are blessed with distinguishable characteristics and each one of them are unique. Even the characters who only appeared for little time can be very memorable to you (I'm talking about a certain character). There aren't any useless characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment - I TOTALLY enjoyed this show. It was astounding. Breathtakingly awesome. This is not the series you could marathon in a day as you will go insane... though I doubt you can wait for the next episode til the next day. The series is very smart, and though there are some tragedies, it's still sweet, beautiful, and heartwarming. The ending doe.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as I had stated before and I will have to state it again now, is a perfect example on how a shounen series must be. Looking for a series with depth and complexity? The perfect series for you. Looking for some laughs? This series also have it, but don't blame me if you get caught up in this marvelous series, even though you didn't mean to.\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is that series, expanding on its original adaption with more action. more story, more characters and an ending that just gives off the feeling of a long journey coming to a close. Whether you agree with my opinion is up to you, but even though it currently sits as the best ranked anime, I feel the need to explain why I love this\n",

      "Story (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one that, like many journey stories, sounds simple. Two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are searching for a Philosopher's Stone in an attempt to take their bodies back following a failed experiment to revive their mother. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This simple setup is all the story really needs to engage you, and from there, you watch as the show will continually introduce more characters, more world building, heavier plot elements, without ever deviating from that simple setup. \r\n",
      "As the show goes on it becomes more and more apparent in what everything is leading up to, and you're able to appreciate the show even more for themes of obsession, moving on, wondering if revenge is really worth it, human potential for creation or destruction, how science can benefit or harm the world and ultimately, working around the theme of Equivalent Exchange. \r\n",
      "I would go into more but to avoid spoilers, let's just say these themes are expertly woven into the narrative so that it still keeps its core focus. They don't make aspects up on the spot, it feels like the story was planned to be this way from the start\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main power system, Alchemy, is very well explained in how intricate it is, how there are different types, different methods to it, what it means for different people and how it affects what happens in front of the Elric brothers.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show does a great job of building suspense, although this element is not as strong as in the 2003 series. Still, the villains are intimidating to really make their presence known, and what they have in store for our heroes never failed to surprise me. You'll see plenty of twists and turns, but the show doesn't solely rely on that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is also comedy thrown into the mix, which occasionally distracts from the overall tone, but is often put in, basically rest spots separated from drama. These jokes tend to hit bull-eyes most of the time, can be creative while also tying well to the established personality of its cast, and since you aren't always expecting a joke, it makes it more surprising when you're slammed with a punchline.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show follows the full story of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, in which the narrative had a lot more of a Shonen feel to it. This isn't a bad thing at all, as while the original was a more suspense-filled psychological show, this one is a Shonen in style and appropriately epic action, but you'll never feel like the narrative doesn't know how to get smart. The show dabbles in its mythos enough for viewers to sink their teeth into, but not so much to lose the audience in technical terms. It's an expertly crafted story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art (9.5/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One aspect that definitely improved over the last series was the artwork and animation. The original series already had fantastic artwork for 2003, with the style trying to replicate the manga in basics but still looking appealing. Every character didn't feel like the same design, even background ones looked different in some way. The action scenes were usually more limited to reflect the more psychological tone but were still pretty good. Studio BONES took Brotherhood's animation to a whole other level.  The Action scenes are consistently fantastic, with loads of detail put into every power, whether it be earth alchemy, lightning alchemy, Bradley's sword fighting, the untapped power of a transmutation circle,  or my personal favorite, Roy Mustang's Flame Alchemy. All of these powers flow beautifully into the action, and with the edition of Xing and Briggs to the narrative, there are even more standout designs to incorporate.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound (9/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was not a single opening or ending I disliked in this show. All of them perfectly replicated what was happening in the show at the time, and the background music is also solid. Not QUITE as good as 03 for some of the background OST, but the tracks very much pull their weight. The dub, seen by many as one of anime's best, is actually an overall improvement. Despite a few recastings, most of the original series cast returned for the reboot, and with the added energy and intensity offered from the source material, they get to showcase their talents better than ever before.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The best aspect of both Fullmetal Alchemist series was easily the characters. Despite their simple journey setup, both are incredibly character driven shows, introducing many characters and giving almost all of them an arc or relevance in the story at some point. Although some characters like Nina, Hughes, Lust and Izumi get less time here compared to the original 2003 series, most of the others either maintain their excellent characters such as the engaging and incredibly well resolved Elric brothers themselves, the dutiful/sisterly but with a tinge of vulnerability Riza Hawkeye, the incredibly buffed and pompous Alex Armstrong, the rough and energetic Winry Rockbell, and my obvious favorite Colonel Roy Mustang, for being both super awesome, and super professional, doing a lot of important maneuvering and achieving an excellent catharsis, yet still going higher. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "While it is true certain characters like Izumi, Lust and Hughes have less screentime to develop them than previously, many other characters get even better characterizations than before such as Scar, Kimblee, Greed, Bradley, Dr. Marcoh, and especially Hohenheim, who not only gets a full character arc in this series, but also ties directly into the scheme of the main villain, as opposed to being a non-character shown very briefly at the end of the previous series with little impact. The introduction of the country Xing and Fort Briggs adds even more characters to the mix. Ling Yao, despite not being the most lovable at first, became my eventual favorite among them for having a very fulfilling development arc. The villains too, despite being less personal than previously, still have interesting characterizations, intentions, and elaborate roles to play in this puzzle piece set up.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost every character has an important role to play, with proper setup on who they are, why they are, and how they are. So many get their own arcs in the narrative that it adds a lot to the overall impact. Unlike the previous series, where a lot of the side arcs felt too periphery from the intended personal conflict, here, they add to a cohesive whole, which I think is the stronger approach. Overall, a fantastically quirky and memorable cast with captivating character depth.\n",

      "This series did not have a dull moment. It continuously kept me engaged with a fantastic and brilliant story that never fails to disappoint, incredible animation, and many three dimensional characters. I highly recommend giving this series a watch, maybe even buying it as well. If for some reason you cannot watch 03, watch this one first but if you can, watch it second. Despite a rushed beginning, its more consistent style, scope, epicness and catharsis will hopefully satisfy.\n",
      "I started Brotherhood after I  finished fma 2003, so not surprisingly I thought this version was... well, it was lighter, I guess? Yes, it was also shounen too. But that didnt bother me very much, after all I'm a sucker for action. But character development was different compared to the 2003 version, or so it seems to me. It is good that ed and al didnt even think about harming another soul till the very end, but after all they've been through, I thought they would at least put some thought in it, if it made sense. Like they did in 2003. I understand\n",

Or maybe it's just based on the shows own hype and popularity? Well, it doesn't matter which it is because Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) has it all. As probably everyone knows, FMAB is a remake of the original Full Metal Alchemist (2003) series; A remake that does pretty much everything right and makes an already great series into one of the greatest series ever. For those of you who have not seen Brotherhood, it is not a \"sequel\" or copy\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I don't want to get too much into the plot since it'd be useless reading since you're going to watch this masterpiece and find out about it's story anyways. The story follows 2 young brothers, Ed and Alphonse Elric, and their struggles in achieving their personal quest.  Edward and Al Elric attempted unsuccessfully to revive their mother using the power of alchemy. In the failure process, the elder brother, Ed, loses a leg, and the younger brother, Al, loses his entire body. Ed manages to attach his brother's soul to a nearby suit of armor, at the cost of his right arm. In the midst of their quest, there are political and military conflicts alongside the darkness of human nature (pandora's box stuff). Greed? Lust? Envy? Gluttony? Truth/Lies? All aspects of our reality that people have to overcome, and FMAB portrays it perfectly. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The plot isn't complicated and symbolic at all yet it gives off the sense of an absolutely genius masterpiece. The show is \"mere\" 64 episodes (not enough for me). Because the show was so long, it had the opportunity to develop their plot to it's fullest potential, and oh boy do they deliver. 64 episodes, and there were absolutely no filler episodes where I was left bored. Skip parts of the show? Unthinkable. Brotherhood does a exceptional job of pacing itself into laying out the foundations of the story as a collection of pieces, and then connecting them all together throughout the series to create a cohesive, masterfully intertwined, and satisfying (tragic) ending. Starting with the very heritage of the main characters and the conspiracy behind the very formation of Amestris. Then the characters figuring out the \"truth\", having to deal with painful experiences, accepting reality/fate, and really growing as a human being. Then portraying the potential and corruption of human beings. With constant sensational battles both psychological and upfront confrontation to keep the viewers entertained... To the very ending where all the questions from the beginning/middle are answered, and the viewers are taught a valuable lesson about humanity-growing up and reality-not as dream-like as we'd like to believe as kids. Epic, Touching/Tragic, Funny, Magical, Simply Amazing. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Greatest vast cast of characters in anime, period. There should be no debate. The main characters aren't given all the screen-time like other shows. FMAB shows the perspectives of so many characters (10+ maybe around 20? Yep--Amazing). What really touched me was that Ed and Al remained true to themselves until the very end. They don't change or learn anything that fundamentally changes them like most \"heroic characters\" They were originally innocent kids who made mistakes just like all human beings. Then they went on the journey to try and correct their mistakes, and through their journey, they learn that there are more things wrong with the world than their own follies; and to repent upon your sins in reality is something of an ambiguous thing... An interesting thing to look for is that although the Elric brothers are on their journey to find the philosopher stone and regain their body, they constantly give up on their quest for the sake of others, to help others, and that, is the true definition of heroism. The other characters aren't there to aid or prevent the Elric brothers achieve their goal, they're there with their own stories. Random characters meet together, and build friendship? Betray eachother/Fall in love? No. FMAB isn't childish like that. But of course, all of the character's pasts and stories all intertwine with one another as the show progresses in a ingeniously woven manner, which eventually leads up to an ideal conclusion that the viewers have no choice to be dazzled by. Every single character is memorable, relatable, and just so damn realistically portrayed with each to their own humanistic feelings. All of them are entertaining to watch as they development and everyone has a moment of truth, where they shine more brightly than the other characters; no one character is like \"the overpowered great heroic guy\" or \"the primary evil psychopathic villain\". To name a few characters that had their own story, had a ton of screen-time, and were highly enjoyable to watch: Roy Mustang (Such a heroic, respectable character, one of best characters ever), Riza Hawkeye, King Bradley, Maes Hughes, Alex Louis Armstrong, Olivier Mira Armstrong, Izumi Curtis, Solf J Kimblee, Winry Rockbell, Scar and the most important character of the entire series (more important than Elric brothers), Van Hohenheim. Furthermore as I've mentioned before, Truth, Envy, Greed, Lust, and Gluttony are all actual formed characters. Their presentations represent all the ominous presences of our reality and how we overcome them. Revenge? Defeating a villain? What does that truly mean? Killing/Getting revenge on your enemy isn't the end of anything. A purpose is never all consuming; and in fact it'll probably make you even more lonely and unfortunate. That they went out on their own again, trying to stick to a promise they made to themselves, to not be helpless, that something that is so simple and grand is the true aim of their life, a life that all of us lead, is inspiring. Beautiful~ And the most amazing aspect of the show is truly Von Hohenheim's character. The ending of the anime is one of the most satisfying and sad/happy at the same time endings to any show ever. The moment we realize that Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood wasn't about mere alchemy, and action, but themes far beyond the interpretation of many viewers that teach us a lesson about life/reality. The moment we realize, that the story was truly about Von Hohenheim and his humanity.\n",

      "Everything about the art in this show is colorful, magical and fantastic. The art is designed by different people, so the animation in Brotherhood is different from the original; imo, Brotherhood's art is much much better. The superb quality for action/battles and alchemy portrayed: There's sword/hand-to-hand combat to guns/tanks to explosions/fire to shadow attacks to alchemy magic such as earth control. The characters were portrayed a little bit differently and uniquely as well, it's something you have to watch to notice (hard to explain). They especially did a wondrous job showing the various locales of Amestris, a country that absorbed many of its neighbors to reach its current state. The sound of the show? The Full Metal Alchemist series is known for it's great music, and FMAB doesn't disappoint; no, it impresses. The openings and endings of FMAB are the greatest I've ever heard. There are 5 openings to the show and they're all addicting and great. Opening 1- Again? Beautiful~ Opening 2 - Hologram? Great~ Opening 3 - Golden Time Lover? Catchy~ Opening 4 - Period? Epic~ Opening 5 - Rain? Sad/Satisfying end~ But the openings/endings aren't the only good thing, other great soundtracks that enhance the mood for specific scenes? Check (Listen to Brothers). Good voice cast? Check. \n",

      "Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a literature masterpiece. Often in great literature pieces there are symbolic objects and characters (next paragraph), and the use of color symbolism. Black, Edward Elric wears a lot of it. Black usually represents death, and the dark aspect of one's nature--often one's own shadow. Ed wearing black represents his mourning for his dead mother, and his self-depression that is stemmed from dissolution and conflict/hardships. The darkness that precedes the spiritual light--reflection of death and destruction of old--rebirth into new/realization. Edward's hair color--yellow often represents the sun/divine light. In Islam it represents wisdom and happiness. But in some places such as Egypt, that color of yellow represents envy and disgrace. The color of yellow in FMAB often mixes together multiple cultures from the world--seen from the philosopher stone. The color green often is associated with life, hope, and happiness. However the portrayal of the color green is ironically used, for in FMAB people who are jealous and hateful towards others usually are associated with green. This may be far-fetched, but I believe that this symbolizes that in reality, with life, hope and happiness, follows death, jealousy, and hatred; one cannot exist without the other. And finally, the color of white: purity (obvious). The philosopher stone's shining of white towards the end marks the beginning of ascent from the abyss-darkness, purification of sins. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Furthermore when I mentioned how FMAB has lots of symbolism and themes about life and reality, I truly meant it. The antagonist of FMAB's name is \"Father\" and he dresses entirely in white. He fulfills the role of an almighty and divine creator; he creates 7 homonculus' and names them: Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, and Lust; the 7 deadly sins. He's supposed to represent Jesus/or a Godlike figure. Also, the marking held by each of the Homunculi are called ouroboros (picture of a circling serpent) that symbolize endless circle of life: birth, death, rebirth. Going back to the Jesus references, Von Hohenheim seeks \"Father\" at a church (duh...) and Hohenheim walks right over the water that's flooding the path (Jesus-Philosopher stone-Divine Being). But an even more symbolic scene representing the same concept was when \"Pride\" claims that \"God is only a figure created by humans; that's all there is to it. If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me, do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!\" Iron-hammer down? Ring any bells? Interestingly enough, King Bradley pins down Colonel Mustang, and he chooses to impale both of Mustang's palms (Jesus-crucification). And, my favorite: Flemel's Cross-- the one that Edward Elric has on his jacket and Al Elric has on his armor. Nicholas Flemel was the creator of this cross, and he was a devout christian that had spent his entire life studying the concept of \"alchemy\". The image of the Flemel's Cross is one where there's a serpent on the cross. There are multiple interpretations of this portrayal, but I think that it signifies the most obvious thing: crucification of a serpent (Satan). This most likely reflects the characters in FMAB overcoming the darkness of reality. All in all, probably the most important symbolism in FMAB was \"The Gate\" which was the connection between our reality, and the world of FMAB. The gate represents the phase of life, and the light illuminating from it represents spiritual growth (of all the characters). The gate closed when Elric lost his mother-- his loss of innocence. Then later once again the gate closed when ____ died in our own reality: a gateway that symbolizes problems with those that open it to see the other side, having no choice but to deal with whatever lies beyond it (temptation). Elric opening the gate to see the \"truth\". Elric's journey began because he opened that gate. \n",

I have to say that FMA:B excelled with its classical OST and outstanding openings. Two of the openings, Again and Period especially stood out for me, Period with it's catchy tune and appealing visuals, and Again with Yui's wonderful voice and maybe some of the best directing in openings to be seen.

And the rest of the supporting cast was also portrayed in a spectacular fashion, they weren't there just to support the main characters. Also, I find it rare for shows to make such good villains as there are in FMA:B. I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt for a villain as they die, but it happened here.

      "\r\n",
      "Let me start off saying, I did not read the manga except the very last vol after completing both series. With that said, I did watch the original made back in 2003. I was IN LOVE with it. I loved the ending and I just thought it had so much depth. But I was well aware that Brotherhood was the remake to\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Now, since I really loved the first one, I was very hesitant to watch the remake. And for those who watched the original, the first 12 or so episodes is pretty much the exact same beginning of FMA. And it was a little annoying just trying get past that, but I did watch it just in case there was a plot difference. I will say, the first episode of FMA:B is pretty much irrelevant to the entire plot. It's pretty much just a \"get the feel of the characters\" episode. But once I hit episode 13, that's where everything got very interesting. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: 10- This anime had so much depth and emotion, that I found myself crying so hard in one episode & then laughing my butt off in the next episode. I will say, this is a dark tale of two brothers trying to restore their bodies. The plot twists that take place is just beautiful. The ending will leave you breathless. I think this anime is perfect for anyone. It has humor, action, suspense, tragedy, and a hint of romance(: Only real downfall was the beginning; I feel as if everything went a lil too fast. And in which one of the character dies (won't say which one) it's not as emotional because of the faster pace and the viewer couldn't get as attached. Only complaint about the plot! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art: 10- I will admit this anime doesn't have 100% outstanding animation compared some anime of their time or newer ones from today. FMA:B was done in 2009. With that being mentioned, it was fairly decent for when it came out and it's better than its original. Everything has a deep tone yet a delightful brightness. It's admirable. This is a somber toned anime and the animation reflect that~!\n",

You'll find yourself loving everything about the soundtracks that they play.\n",

If you've seen the original, you need to just have an open mind with a new take on the characters. Edward's dad would be one of them along  with Scar. I also really love how they introduced new characters that weren't in the original. Also, the females in this anime are strong and can hold their own, which as a young women like myself, I can really appreciate.

      "This is the last anime that needs another review, but I couldn’t resist. The Fullmetal Alchemist franchise’s significance to anime is rivaled only by shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. The original version from 2003 stands as one of my favourite series of all time, as it is one of the most well rounded shows that I’ve seen in the anime medium, and I believe it’s a must watch for all anime fans. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fast forward to 2009, when Bones released Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, a faithful remake to the manga, which was still being written while the 2003 version was being released (which led\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "to the overall plot diverging from the manga). Brotherhood has been critically acclaimed, and has often been considered superior to its 2003 counterpart. While I believe that it’s a fantastic show (and believe me – if the million fanboys/girls squealing isn’t enough, let me tell you that Brotherhood is AMAZING), and it does indeed do a few things better than the 2003 version, it does fall short in a few areas.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Plot/Presentation\r\n",
      "So Brotherhood follows the source material more faithfully. Does that automatically mean it’s better? Well, yes and no. One of the main criticisms against 2003 is that it diverged from the original plotline of the manga. While the original source material had some magnificent content, the mere fact that Brotherhood is more faithful doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s better. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let’s start with the flaws first. The first 10 or so episodes are extremely rushed, and, to be frank, shitty. Pivotal moments that build not only the foundation of the entire plot, but also key moments in the development for a few main characters, felt hurried, and I couldn’t feel the dramatic tension of the situations at all. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I honestly hated Brotherhood at that point, but it eventually got better. The director eventually found a consistent pace that worked for the show. It was still fast paced and incredibly engaging, but it slowed down just enough for the show the flow naturally.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main problem with the entirety of the show is the comedy. The manga had lots of comedy, and though I haven’t read all of the series, the comedy worked decently well to an extent. The show tries to copy the manga’s humour, and it just doesn’t work when brought to life on the screen. A lot of the tender and dramatic moments of the show are completely destroyed by characters suddenly jumping into chibi form for a quick laugh. The transitions between the drama and comedy in Brotherhood is horrendous and above all, inappropriate. Plus, the recurring jokes get way too old way too fast (e.g. people teasing Ed about his height is funny at first, but loses its effect). \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The world of FMA can be rather… dark, and it’s beyond me why such inappropriate comedy is placed in the most out of place situations. Luckily, like my issue with the pacing, the humour eventually became a bit tamer, but it still irked me at times.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Remember how I said that the mere fact that the show follows the manga more faithfully doesn’t mean that it’s better? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The 2003 version saw this, and it did its best to tone down the humour just enough for the show to feel more genuine. It still had the wacky FMA slapstick that everyone loves, but unlike Brotherhood, it was saved for when it wouldn’t interrupt with pivotal dramatic/emotional moments. \r\n",
      "However, it’s not to say Brotherhood does a bad job with its tender bits either. When it’s done right, it’s done well. \n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The entirety of the story revolves around the theme of ‘Brotherhood’, like the title suggests. You see this with both the protagonists and the antagonists. You see this bond with the Elric brothers, the military, with Fort Briggs, and even with the homunculi. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The plot itself, while having some issues with its presentation, has the word ‘epic’ written all over it. The world of FMA is a grand one, and so are the rules of alchemy, which is what makes this show special in the fantasy genre. Alchemy is not magic – to obtain, one must give something of equal value (The Law of Equivalent Exchange). There are many rules of alchemy, and as the show progresses, you learn more about alchemy itself and its effect on other people, both positively and negatively. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is one of the most daring shows I’ve seen in any medium ever, as it goes beyond what the fantasy genre is usually capable of. Brotherhood has a monster of a plot, and somehow it manages to handle its many plot threads with care without seeming convoluted. Each and every subplot receives closure (for the most part) and they all have their impact on the story at large. This is hands down the best part about and so this show deserves praise for that.\n",

      "Characters\r\n",
      "For me, what I love most about the world of FMA is the characters. The story begins with the tragic tale of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, two of my favourite characters in anime.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Edward is the daring brother, the taker of chances, and the intuitive genius of alchemy for his age. He’s strong, he’s flawed, and he is the famous Fullmetal Alchemist. Alphonse is the one who stops and thinks, and throughout the story, he wishes to prove his worth and be more useful to everyone. He can be considered as the moral compass in the entire cast. What I absolutely adore about their relationship is how much they want to save each other before themselves. Edward has lost an arm and a leg, and Alphonse has lost his entire body and is forced to live in a suit of armour, yet all they care about is each other. You can’t ask for better leads like these two. They develop and flesh out nicely as the story goes on. Few relationships can be so tragic, beautiful, and touching. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood has a huge cast of side characters, and somehow manages to give the majority of them enough screentime for each of them to leave an impact on me. All the characters have their own motives, relationships, and place in the story at large, and you get to see it all. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certain characters’ roles and relationships were enlarged in Brotherhood, making their presence far more significant then in the 2003 version. For example, Winry is not only bigger a character in Brotherhood, but her relationship with Edward in particular is far more fleshed out. Winry keeps him grounded. You see her take care of his injuries, scold him, tease him, and most importantly, fall in love with him. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could go on and on about the characters, but I’ll let you learn about them yourselves. Overall, Brotherhood has a memorable, fantastic, and well used cast\n",

      "Art/Animation\r\n",
      "Bones, you beast of a studio. It’s a wonder how consistent the animation is from Episode 1 to 64. Most long running anime tend to lose its steam when it comes to production values as the show goes on. \r\n",
      "Not Brotherhood. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the animation is not always perfect, it’s still crisp, clear, and consistent. Considering the show’s length, its consistency is an achievement in itself. Equal time and care is also put in the character designs. All of the characters are definable, vivid, and full of life. The background scenery can be absolutely stunning to boot. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fight scenes range from boring to extremely mind blowing (particularly fights involving Mustang and the final showdown). However, FMA was never about the action, so I can’t really complain, as I feel that it would’ve let the show down if it were more action-oriented. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only complaint I have, albeit a minor one, is the use of lighting. It can seem a bit flat at times, but overall, this show is very visually pleasing to the eye.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Music/Voice Acting\r\n",
      "When it comes to the music, the openings and endings are where Brotherhood shines. I’ve yet to see OP’s and ED’s so memorable, gripping, and energetic. I loved each and every one of them except for the 3rd OP and ED. Even though I don’t usually listen to Japanese music, I loved the songs. Plus, when the songs are also used as inserts during any given episode, it brings the biggest smile to my face. Standouts go to OP 1 and 4 and ED 2, which is a touching pop ballad called ‘Let it Out’. Even though I couldn’t understand the lyrics without translation, it still brought a few tears to my eyes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack itself is very solid one. There is a wide range in this soundtrack, from upbeat to suspenseful, and the soundtrack is used well. I’ve no complaints. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA has been considered to be among the shows that have superior dubs than most in anime, and honestly, I could see why. There isn’t a single miscast here, and every one of the VA’s played their role amazingly well. For example, I was a little hesitant to hear that Alphonse’s VA was replaced, but all that hesitation withered away after I heard Maxey Whitehead’s portrayal of him. Her performance came of just as genuine as Aaron Dismuke’s.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It’s hard to pick out standouts, mainly because every VA went beyond the call of duty with these characters. I loved this dub that much. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a rather disappointing start, Brotherhood more than makes up for it, as it becomes a huge rollercoaster ride until its epic finale and touching conclusion. With a plot that screams epic, fantastic characters, masterful production values, and an eargasmic dub, I wish I could rate this show higher. I really do. However, the few flaws were unfortunately major ones, and they took a huge toll on the show as a whole. Consistent pacing and tone are two important building blocks that form a solid story, and unfortunately Brotherhood lacks in both areas. Nevertheless, don’t let these flaws stop you from watching this show, as it more than makes up for it. If you haven’t watched anything from the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, I suggest watching the 2003 version first and then watching Brotherhood. \n",

      "Now before I close the longest review I’ve ever written, I’d like to address one commonly asked question in the anime community: is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood worthy enough to be ranked #1 on MAL? While I do not believe Brotherhood is THE BEST ANIME EVER, I will say it’s among the greats, and its universal appeal is undeniable. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood captures what anime is and the great heights of which this medium is capable of. I couldn’t think of another show that is more worthy than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the face of anime.  \n",

      "If you're looking for a good action, shounen and adventure type of anime, then you have to watch FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Even if you're not a big shounen fan I guarantee that this will change your perspective about these types of anime. Overall it is an outstanding anime well worth watching all of the 64 episodes. \n",

Moreover, this anime has an epic plotline that bounds to keep the viewer attached to the screen their watching it in.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     Another reason why is this anime great is because of the art, sound and the characters. The art isn't really something special, its just typical animation you see in most anime but it was so carefully made and absolutely perfect that made it well worth mentioning in this review. The producers have done an amazing job with the soundtrack as well, from the opening and ending theme songs to the music playing while the story develops in each episode that just matches the situation completely. I am sure that you will love the music playing as much as I did. Moving on, the characters, generally the characters were very interesting due to the fact that each one of them had a different personality the good guys and the villains as well. There wasn't much of a character development but im sure you can overlook that flaw comparing it to the fact that everyone was different from each other.\n",

If you're a shounen fan then you probably have already watched it and if not then I suggest 100% to go see by yourself, also if you're not a shounen fan give it a shot it might even change your opinion. For all the above reasons FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets a final score of 10/10\n",

Brotherhood came out at a time where Bones was getting desperate, so they just thought \"Hey, let's just milk one of our old successful series, except not put in half as much heart and effort as we did the first time around, but instead add in more mindless action and forced humor!\" And apparently it worked. It's just a mindless kids show and nothing more.\n",

      "Brotherhood's one-note show-off pompous characters and excruciatingly loud, bombastic and optimistic atmosphere will make you drool with boredom. Ed and Al came off as more or less your typical Mary Sues. None of their actions ever had any consequences, and the narrative very rarely bothered to challenge and/or question their misguided idealism. And even when it did, their juvenile beliefs always triumphed. In the end, they were still very much the naive little children they were in the beginning of the story. Whereas in the 2003 series, the Elric brothers noticeably grew more jaded, broken and emotionally distant as the show went on, which is understandable if you witness all the stuff they go through. They came to realize the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows and that equivalent exchange is indeed complete dog crap. Very often in Brotherhood, the narrative options to bend the show's internal physics to comply circumstances to their favor. Ed and Al were just too much of fetishistic, moralistic and tone deaf idealists. Ed and Al had flaws in the beginning of the story. But as the show went on, they just became more and more Stuish. They started taking down their opponents with relative ease.\n",

      "There's nothing wrong with winning. However, if your protagonists win all the time within a blink of an eye, it just takes away all sense of tension and investment. There was never a single moment in Brotherhood where the protagonists were in actual legitimate danger. Thinking you can protect everyone is in all honesty, quite infantile. People around you are gonna die, no matter what, and sometimes there's little you can do to save them. Even when the protagonists lost in a battle against the antagonists, you knew they would always find a way to worm out of the situation, either by other protagonists making a dramatic entrance at just the right moment or through flat out dues ex ma-china. Just watch the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime from start to finish and you'll see how much more realistic, secretive, and overall thrilling the villains really were throughout that series. Yet in Brotherhood, they were all rather shallow and bland villains who lost their capability of rational thought whenever the plot called for it. If you watch Brotherhood more and more carefully, you'll see how much each and every major protagonist were shielded by plot armor just because the plot said so. Hell you even got faced-heel turn villains, most notably Scar, whose race was destructed by the military in the war, who also was shielded by plot armor till the very end and never pays for any of his actions earlier in the story. The original manga author became too much of a wimp to kill off major protagonists in later chapters after the death of Maes Hughes, a friend of the Elric brothers and Roy Mustang. She obviously gotten numerous fan letters telling her never to kill another main protagonist ever again. She became too concern with pleasing the mainstream public instead of actually trying her best to make a good story in her original manga. And by the end, her work became fully mediocre and isn't really worth reading at all after only the first time.\n",

      "The protagonists are noticeably more heroic and chivalrous in Brotherhood, as opposed to broken, depressed wrecks. Their actions very rarely stray into morally gray territory. This is a story about the military and the human beings are in it. It is suppose to be a drama and tragic series, along with it being somber and realistic. Not filled with cluster forced humor chi-bi faces every few minutes during a serious moment where the author wants you to be immersed in. Overall, her writing skills are sub-par at best and doesn't have any experience on the battlefield. No wonder why her work ended up being plain trash. Most of the background music featured in Brotherhood are not good either. In fact, some of them sounded pretty childish and were overall poorly used in most cases.\n",

The original author added so much plot devices, plot armors and plot holes into her work. And don't even get me started on the ending. Words cannot describe how much I truly despise the ending to a greater degree. All I can say is that the author was just doing a rush job and never thought anything through at all. All Brotherhood has going for it is the new animation, the villain King Bradley aka Wrath, and some of the flashback scenes prior to the start of the show.\n",

I give art a mediocre score because it isn't anything special. The story is what I have a problem with. The very idea of the show/manga is great. I like the idea of alchemy. The story quickly became a predictable straight forward festival of nothingness. I\n",

I just did not care. I give points though for when FMAB made me cry at (spoiler) funeral. I thought it was easy to guess what a Philosophers' stone was made of. I don't think this show is worth your time and you don't have to watch this show to be considered a true anime fan. That would be Cowboy Bebop.\n",
      "Extremely overrated and it is beyond me how this anime has such good ratings. The highlight of this anime for me was when Ed encounters the chimera girl, it was a super dark and sad moment that made me think the rest of the series would be of this quality. But no, it then becomes an unfunny boring cliche mess with stupidly one-note characters.\r\n",

      "Note though that I have not seen the 2003 anime nor have I read the manga ; I bring this up because a lot of people who are fans of the 2003 anime bash on Brotherhood for either being a rehash of the mythos and not having as much 'impact' as the 2003 one. I don't exactly know what they are going on about as I'm not a fan of the 2003 version but I respectfully disagree with them. That aside, why do I\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "think FMAB is one of the greatest anime of all time? Because it gets literally everything that a good story should have right and more.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For one thing, it is an epic, epic story. A lot goes on in every episode and the scale of the journey is big, spanning a whole continent plus some of its neighbors. Its one of the few modern works of fiction that deserves to be called a saga (saga means heroic journey of great length) and its world is really unique, original and actually pretty believable. Sure, alchemy is unrealistic. Sure, it does not exist. No, that doesn't really make 'realistic' anime better than FMAB. Haven’t you guys heard of suspension of disbelief?! As long as a world sticks to its own rules and FMAB does just this, I devour a work and its world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whenever I search out any work of fiction, the first thing I look for are great and compelling characters and when it comes to character, FMAB hit it right out of the park; it has some of the most inspiring, unique, compelling and relatable characters ever, be they villains, heroes, allies or even minor characters. Edward Elric never gives up no matter how much crap he goes through (yeah, sound familiar? kenshinhimuragutskenzotenmagokuetc... hey, that’s not a bad thing, it's actually a very good thing). He is a bit whiny when it comes to his pride and height but not when he goes through actual bad stuff. No, when he does you can be sure he'll try to fix it by any means possible. Al is also a very great character; looking up to his brother and helping him out with his quest to gain their bodies back and honestly, can you imagine FullMetal Alchemist without Alphonse? The two complete each other with their brotherly love and companionship and this companionship helps them out a ton in their journey.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of the Elric allies, I will not mention as there are too flipping many. However, they are all very fun, likable and when some of them do die, it's heartbreaking and haunting. Yes, even the death of THAT character that died in episode 20 or so of the 2003 FMA but died in episode 10 of FMAB was very tragic and haunting. I could not believe it and the rest of the series became really suspenseful because of that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The villains are also great. Scar is mysterious and interesting, the Homunculi are for the most part fun and even scary and Father who turns out to be the big bad is a fascinating, horrifying and a really effective villain. One thing that did bother me though and the next sentence is a minor spoiler for a character death, was that the homunculus Lust was killed off too quickly whereas according to the stuff I read, she was a much more interesting character in the 2003 version. It did bother me a little but not by much because the Homunculi Wrath, Pride and of course, Greed more than made up for any loss of her character. I think my most favorite villain in Brotherhood ha to be Wrath. He's just really scary and a very real threat to our heroes and I won't spoil who he is but it's really surprising. And then there is Envy. Biggest. Bastard. Ever. Well, except for Griffith. And Johann. And Dan'Ichiro Sanka. And Hitler. What, only fictional characters count?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMAB also has without a doubt the best depiction of women in all of fiction. Sure, there are the usual tsunderes in this anime like Winry and Izumi Curtis but they still come out as fully fledged characters and despite Winry being an engineering nerd and Izumi and Riza always moving and being utterly badass, THEY STILL COME OFF AS FEMININE. Finally, a work of fiction where a (relatively) well adjusted woman can actually be herself and acts all girly but at the same is still very competent instead of always needing to be rescued. No women pretending to be like men as if their femminity was a disease needing to be wiped out, nor are there any dumb blondes who get themselves captures or whine about being rescued!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then there is the Father of the Elric Brothers. I won't spoil his character but trust me he's really compelling and great.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Does FMAB have flaws? Well yes, but some of these 'flaws' aren't really flaws. A criticism I often heard for Brotherhood was that it didn't pack as much punch as the 2003 version. I disagree so much with this reasoning because FMAB is one of those very rare anime that brought put all of my feelings: it made me cry (those war scenes, oh my gosh...), it made me think (war is bad but can it be used to do good?), it made me angry (Envy you bastarded son of a...), it even made me happy and elated. I, an 18 year old man at the time, found myself cheering for the characters out loud when they were doing something awesome as if I was watching my favorite football team scoring a goal. No other anime or manga, not even Berserk made me do such things. Then there were the times where I was really disturbed. I think Brotherhood is one of the most violent anime out there. It's not Berserk levels in its blood and gore but it's fairly graphic especially when the Homunculi themselves are getting beaten up. However, those scenes weren't really disturbing and to me, episode 4 of the anime was one of the saddest moments I've ever seen. I did not see that moment coming and when it did, I was speechless and felt really empty inside. So to me, the idea that Brotherhood didn't pack a big punch is a non-sensical argument as it really did get a lot of different feelings from me.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The comedy was also pretty nice. Edward despite being such a badass is hysterical when he's all angry about his own height (IF YOU PRAY, YOU'LL DEFINITELY BECOME TALLER!) and the funniest joke involved Winry actually KILLING Edward with her wrench. That scene came out of nowhere and the fact it was never mentioned again made it all the more hilarious. The comedy never takes away from the mood though and like the Higurashi anime, the comedy made the characters seem closer to us and friendly; comedy when done well can actually give characters a ton of depth. Edward may never give up and he's still really smart but he's still impulsive and stubborn.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Someone else told me that FMAB doesn't stand on its own, meaning you have to watch it from the beginning in order to understand the plot instead of picking it up 20 episodes or so in and starting from there. While I am someone who thinks that works of fiction like books or films in a series should stand on their own, to me it doesn't count for TV series animated or not. TV series have a huge advantage over films, animated or not, in that they have much more time and narrative devices to explain their story and in my opinion, this should be taken advantage of. Not every series has to have an episodic format (like Cowboy Bebop which I didn't like) especially if the story doesn't call for it and why would anyone watch any series with only 64 episodes 20 episodes or so in? While it's true that episodic anime are more mainstream and probably bring in a bigger audience, the fandom that you bring in with a non-episodic anime will still be big and it will be a dedicated fandom always analyzing and dissecting your work.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If I had to name a real flaw Brotherhood had, I do think the first 10 episodes were a bit rushed. Oh they were still deep, well written and compelling but compared to the rest of the anime I agree that they were rather rushed. Sometimes the animation does look a bit off model and a character in the last episode does look a much older than he really is due to off-model animation. However, none of these flaws took away from my enjoyment of the anime and I find the story to have very little flaws. There was really only one moment where I didn't quite buy that a character would do such a thing because I always thought that this character was way smarter than she really is. Also, what on earth happened to my dear Sheska?! I want to know more about her even though she is as minor as you can get with a character!\n",
      "\r\n",
      " Either way, the plot is as close to perfect as you can get. Hell, for such a complex system of fantastic science (alchemy is not magic. Even the Catholic Church studied alchemy in the middle ages, look it up), I understood and believed everything so that when the characters did search and discuss the different forms of alchemy, I understood what they were saying and was never confused.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My final verdict for FMAB is a 10/10 for masterpiece. It is a definite must watch and while fans who saw the 2003 version may dislike Brotherhood's early episodes, I've seen just as many fans love both equally so it's highly, highly recommended. It has something for everybody, is relatively free from fanservice and it's really fun and awesome in the end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PS: About FMAB being the greatest anime ever. Lets be realistic now, while it certainly is one of the best, no anime or manga that is truly great is better than another. FMAB is part of the pantheon of great anime, those anime that have alot of  influence on the world and are also very well written.  I won't name them but FMAB is definitely one of the greatest ever.\n",
      "This really is an outstanding piece of anime and artwork in every regard, the music score is exceptional as well and very memorable.  So MANY things in Brotherhood are all memorable that you really will not be able to just select one thing first, nor will you be able to pick just one item either.  This is an anime that is hitting on all cylinders and scoring on all marks, there is little else they could've done to make this better other than expanding the story and length to increase the character depth; but, to be honest that may have been overboard. \n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Deeper characters are really the only area were they could've improved a bit, but not by much as all the main characters are hashed out very well.  It is in fact many of the evil characters that could've used some extra storytelling, but that is a hard thing to accomplish in almost any show for the bad guy(s).  Overall there is no real lack of background or dimensionality to these characters other than perhaps their personal or love relationships, which were always handled for the most part at an arm's length.  Winry and Ed's relationship out of all of them really could have used an extra bit of elbow grease, so that when the end finally arrives it really would've meant that much more to Ed, to THEM, and to US!  Adding in some fireworks for other characters would've been nice, but this WAS realistically a show based in a VERY heavily militaristic city and community.  So fraternization, much like army life in almost any country in the world, is basically forbidden until you are off-duty AND off base.  This is why Ed's relationship COULD'VE been helped as we follow them and they DO get off base and they DO go around Winry, specifically.  But, I'm complaining about nothing to be honest...the show is more than fine as it stands.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation is wonderful and rich.  The combat especially is always great and for some reason, with this anime specifically, it has left a very unique mark on the anime landscape.  When I think of how the animation runs together and the battles there is no other anime I can think of that is remotely like it.  So far it IS a unique and one-of-kind creation.  It is definitely a anime series worth a re-watch and a re-watch after that!  It is that good and evokes so many great memories of adventure, danger, wonder, intrigue, and with that comes the fun of cheering Ed and Al on (and many of their compatriots as well)!  Getting people that have never watched this together to give it a run through is more than worth it so that they can do exactly what I just said in the sentence before and with that you can relive that experience vicariously through them; it really does make it almost just as fun as seeing it the first time...  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond the animation you have the wonderful music.  The music CANNOT be left out here...  It is just as important I truly believe as the characters, the story, the animation, and anything else that has gone into the production of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  This will be some of the most memorable music you will ever listen to in anime.  You may find yourself when done with the series seriously considering buying all of the music for the series.  The orchestral music for the main portion of the show is wonderful and while I may not like all of the ending or opening theme songs, you will more than likely find a few you do like as Brotherhood will have a lot for you to pick from when all is said and done.  The music had to be mentioned in it's own right as a separate issue, as it's so well done it deserves a lot of merit and needs to be mentioned as a reason to watch the series as well.  It IS that good!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond everything I've mentioned, some small details that I should go ahead and say is that the English dubbed version of Brotherhood is more than worth your time.  Not only is all the voice acting done VERY well, but all of the miscellaneous noises have been changed as well as things that typically are not like small text on screen (though not having to do with dubbing, it does have to do with the overall \"English adaptation\" that has been created.  The English dubbing, plus the fact that they have gone to the trouble of replacing ALL of the text (everywhere!) to English as well shows the high level of commitment they had in making sure that not only did Japanese audiences get a great version, but so did English audiences!  I will be forever thankful for that as this is easily one of my most favorite anime--it just got so many things RIGHT!  The re-watchability of this anime is very high.  Not only because it's good, but to catch the small things you may have missed the first go around; especially, if you are not someone that grabs all of the more complicated details right off the bat as this show definitely has some, the farther into the show the more that will pop-up (and more for you to pay attention for IN THE PAST)...   \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is epic, how else can I put it.  It is amazing how far you go from where you start and finally where you end at.  This IS an adventure; an adventure of two brothers that have suffered from a grievous wound, both mentally, emotionally, and physically...and to some extent it has even taken a toll on their souls...  We follow these brothers as they figure out how to repair this horrible damage they've inflicted upon themselves and in the process they make a lot of friends, they make a lot of enemies, they learn A LOT, and that simple promise they made to each other to heal each other and to free themselves of their self-made curse might be just enough to get them through anything.  They learn in the end what matters and what doesn't and they realize those that are evil simply just never learn that lesson.\n",

      "Overall I give this a 10/10.  The weakest areas I think are characters at 9/10; but trust me this isn't a big decrease, it's more that I wish they would have added more onto characters that were already there or spent even more time on specific development areas on the main characters (I always want more character back-story...).  The next negative is the art area at 9/10.  Again this isn't a big decrease and in certain areas, like combat, it doesn't apply as they've done a spectacular job here.  Really all they could have done is added more team members and gotten a bigger budget with a bigger studio/editing crew.  Without that I'm not exactly sure how they would hit 10/10.  BUT, they have far more positives than they ever could have in the negative department.  While I don't really like all the opening or ending thematic music for Brotherhood, the actual music for the show is beautiful and basically puts a large amount of the anime produced in the garbage bin when comparing music score.  If you want an idea of what I'm talking about, just head over to Youtube and do a search for FMA: Brotherhood OST music score (CD track; I think the one you buy has 84 tracks, I could be wrong though).  Then you can listen to a LARGE chunk of Brotherhood's music--it's worth your time. \n",

      "If you enjoy anime, you can watch the first few episodes of Brotherhood easily around on the net; either on Youtube or many other places, but try to give Brotherhood atleast till episode ten if for some reason you don't like it off the bat.  Brotherhood is a \"little\" slow at the start; by \"slow\" I mean it hasn't gotten into the \"swing\" of it's main story arc.  Once THAT starts up, that is when Brotherhood turns into a roller-coaster and you are stuck in the seat until the ride comes to a complete stop!  This is easily a show I recommend to get on Blu-Ray as a blind buy!  WHAT A RIDE!\n",

      "The story is about two brothers (Edward and Alphonse Elric) that know alchemy (to manipulate objects and transform one object into another. They are bounded by the basic law of alchemy: in order to gain something you have to sacrifice something of the same value). But they have made one horrible mistake in the past. They have done the taboo of alchemy, they have done alchemy with human lives. Trying to resurrect\n",

Edward was able to replace the soul of his brother to an armor in the neighbourhood. But needed to sacrifice one of his arms for that. Then the two brothers joined the army in order to get their bodies back. From here the real story begins. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This anime is unbelievable if you think about what they all handle. The main question of the story is “what is the value of life?”. This is the question where the protagonist had problems with during the whole series. Actually the main reason why that I find this is a very serious shonen is because the way they let you see politics. It is unbelievable how good and detailed it is. You see things like corruption, racism, religion, terrorism, people with a god complex, … . The way you see everybodys thoughts and however you can completely disagree with them you understand what they think and why. The way everybody from different sectors thinks about the value of life is probably one of the most interesting things about the serie since it is combined with all the other thoughs of them. What does people do to get power/succes?, how do people change once they get it? are some other interesting questions that will be answered as well. You can really make endless compares to history. Par example the way the regime attacks a certain religion is comparable with hitler’s regime that attacked the jewish, the one from that religion that wanted revenge and became a terrorist is comparable with al qaida, ... . Thats why I think this serie explains politics even better than Code Geass.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I haven’t even talked about the homunculi yet. There even more interesting than politics. It are creatures that thinks they are the evolution of mankind since they are kinda superior to humans. But the most interesting part is that they all have one emotion. Such as lust, envy, greedy, pride, … .It basically shows what these are and what people do if they're obsessed with that emotion.\n",

      "The openings/endings are very good however the rest of the OST isn’t that good or special. The art isn’t anything special either. The characters are very good not that they are such special themselve but there just plenty of original and interesting ones. The amusement was okay but I wasn’t that exciting while watching it in the first 40 episodes. The other 24 where good of excitement but again nothing special. The fights are very original with all that alchemy shit so these where very exciting to watch. In my opinion that serie had to do it with the story and didn’t had anything too special for the rest however the story makes up for everything and makes it a absolutely a need to watch anime for every shounen lover. So don’t think it is or I find this not worthful to watch just cause I gave it only a eight. Eight is considered as very good and I don’t like to give all good shows tens cause then my favorites won’t come out my list anymore.\n",

I've seen a lot of other people's reviews and I'm constantly seeing the same pattern, which is that everyone is comparing Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to the first series, Fullmetal Alchemist. I'm here to break that pattern and say I love them both equally. I feel that one can't compare them, because both series are very different.\n",

      "I don't like when animes don't follow mangas, but the first series wasn't suppose to follow the manga and it took a totally different turn that was amazing in it's own way. For the brotherhood series (which went just like the manga), was also an amazing story. The brotherhood version focused more on the corruption in the world, while the first version still did as well, but more emotional. The first series made me cry more, because almost everything died in the series (while the second series I still cried, but got more pissed at all the corruption in their world). In other words, one isn't better than the other, because both series have their perks and fill in the gabs that each one had.\n",

And without fail, those two always stick together. There bond is just as strong in both series. For other characters, some didn't exists in the first series that existed in brotherhood. Some characters were more important/less important in brotherhood than they were in the first series, which didn't effect either stories. In both series, one either hates a character, loves them, or has no opinion on...but it's mostly love or hate.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall:\r\n",
      "One series isn't better than the other, one was meant to go by the manga and one wasn't. Both stories were amazing, truthful, and brought tears to one's eyes. I love and appreciate both series, and I hope you do too. I suggest people to watch both  series (but to watch Fullmetal Alchemist then Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, because if you watch Brotherhood first you will just find yourself constantly critiquing how the first series doesn't follow the manga...so you won't enjoy the messages each series has to offer you.) I watched the first version when I was like seven years ago and I just finished Brotherhood, and not once did I compare.\n",

      "A few years ago in my freshman year of college, I had a number of friends who were extremely into anime. Other than watching a little bit of Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Naruto as a kid, I had little familiarity with anime. I proceeded to watch a few Miyazaki classics, and then FMA:B as my first \"serious\" anime series with. So understand that this rave review is partially due to nostalgia from those days, and you may not think it is as good as I do for that reason. Nonetheless, I probably should've started with\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "a different anime, because after watching FMA:B it is extremely difficult to find anything that compares.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As you can tell from the synopsis, the plot is incredibly original. But the synopsis doesn't quite tell you how deep the plot runs as it deals with some heavy and dark themes. It is all delivered with brilliant execution that has you on the edge of your seat for the entirety of the series, especially after the first fifteen episodes or so. Though the pacing is a little fast at times  (especially at first, though this is mostly because it is assumed the viewer has seen the original first or has some familiarity with the manga), there is very little to complain about.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it is a remake of another series, it is difficult to write a review without comparisons. First of all, I would recommend seeing the original first; I did not and I missed a few details in my first viewing of the series (I have since rewatched a few times after watching the original). It is not absolutely necessary to watch the original and Brotherhood certainly can stand on its own, but it does help a little to be at least familiar with the original. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood starts out largely the same as the original series (and the manga), though paced a little faster. For various reasons, largely because of the slower pace and better character development, I prefer the beginning of the original series. After episode ten or so, Brotherhood goes off in a very different direction from the original to better follow the manga. This is where I begin to significantly prefer brotherhood as it thematically covers far more ground and develops a number of the other characters in a superior way (most notably Scar, Envy, Edward, Mustang, and Wrath). Edward, especially, is far more dynamic in Brotherhood and has a better connection to the theme of the show. While the original dealt more exclusively with the ethical implications and nature of human equality, Brotherhood deals with those themes more subtlety as well as the fallibility of human knowledge, cultural and philosophic differences between the East and West, the brutal nature of war, the ethics of retributive justice, and the role of science and religion in the formation of ethics. All of these themes are dealt with in a common thread of deep humanism, and the ending is more complete and more satisfying than the original. I could go on for days about the numerous thought provoking themes this anime delivers, but I won't and it's really impossible to do justice to the plot in this review. I give it a 10/10 for plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it comes to art, Brotherhood is slightly better animated than the original, mostly because of technological advances between 2003 and 2009. Though the animation isn't the best feature of this anime and is hardly the best Studio Bones has produced (that honor going to Sword of the Stranger), it is still substantially above average. What really artistically stands out about FMA:B is the directing style. Though it is action-heavy like most shounen anime, it avoids all of the pitfalls of the genre. There’s no campy battle cries, the battle scenes (if you can even call them that) are actually well directed and not action-for-the-sake of action, everything isn’t immediately explained to the viewer by the participants in the battle, and the points of interest are not the battle scenes in the first place or even the powers the characters have through alchemy--but the quiet scenes where the characters reflect on their situation. It is the only shounen (other than perhaps the original) I’ve seen that I could call cerebral and reflective. There are a number of fascinating camera shots and interesting directing decisions throughout the series. For example, the way the entire end scene of  the episode “Backs in the Distance” is directed is some of the best cinematography one can ask for (you’ll know what I mean when you see it). Though there are a couple moments, especially near the beginning, where the atmosphere of the anime is a little tainted by some childish humor and over-done jokes about Ed’s height (it’s easy to forget amongst all the genocide and references to classical epistemology that this was marketed to a younger audience), it is overall very well directed.  It gets a 9/10 for art.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it comes to sound, there’s a bit of a dilemma here. It may be a controversial opinion, but this (and the original) is the absolute only case where I prefer the dub to the sub. Ed’s voice in the sub sounds like a stereotypical and--to be honest--a little annoying shounen protaganist that does not do justice to the depth of his character, and Alphonse just comes off as whiny in the sub, almost reminiscent of a uke in a bad yaoi. Other than that, the sub is decent and doesn’t really detract from the series overall; but the dub is where this anime really shines. Vic Mignogna does a brilliant job as Edward Elric, and the rest of the cast, with a few exceptions, act very well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack also bears worth mentioning. I actually paid $50 plus shipping from Japan to the US to buy this soundtrack, that is how good it is. I listen to it quite a bit and many of the tracks are beautiful and match the scenes they are put in perfectly. This is among the best OSTs for anime you will find out there, and even overshadows some of the elements I do not like  at the sub. That said, the OST probably could’ve used a bit more tracks as it gets a little repetitive towards the end. For this reason, I give it a 9/10 for sound.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters in this anime are also extremely well done. Almost all the major characters are highly dynamic with deep back stories, and even the more minor characters are highly likeable and contribute significantly to the plot, with a few exceptions. And the connections between this anime’s intricate plot and deep themes and the characters go well beyond what almost any other anime does. Most of the characters are also vehicles for symbolism. Brotherhood goes far beyond being good in the department of character symbolism, and ventures into being an exemplar of what anime can be as an artform. 10/10 for characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clearly, given the way I’ve been raving about it and the fact that I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rewatched it (I’d guess around six), it’s fair to say that I think this anime is enjoyable. And not just enjoyable in the sense of entertaining (though it certainly is) or even enjoyable in the sense that you tend to lose yourself in the story (though you certainly do), but it is enjoyable in the sense of being completely enlightening thematically, as I’ve said before. If you want to think deeply about an anime, look no further than brotherhood. I even went as far as to use brotherhood in a college paper to illustrate some philosophical implications of Richard Rorty’s rejection of Cartesianism (granted, it was for a seminar on anime). Even if you don’t really want to think about an anime intellectually, it is enjoyable just for the sake of being a good story that you can lose yourself into. Whether you want a deep thoughtful anime, an action-packed shounen that you can get excited about, or just a good story to simply enjoy for its own sake, Brotherhood delivers. I typically use it as the go to to introduce newcomers to anime, and as you can see from its place in the rankings, it is much beloved by the most experienced of anime viewers. 10/10 for enjoyment.\n",

      "As of the writing of this review, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood sits at number two overall on the MAL list, and has historically taken the number one spot on many occasions (and probably will again in the future). If you haven't seen this before, then, you are probably approaching it with extremely high expectations. Typically when people approach a show with that high of expectations, they are disappointed. FMA:B is an exception to this. It competes for my absolute favorite anime, and tops the favorite lists of many others, for a very good reason. Call me an otaku fanboy, but I can’t rave about it enough. There are only two animes I’ve ever seen that I’ve given a 10/10, and this is one of them.\n",

      "Story is awesome, the “Elric brothers” Al and Edward are on a quest to find their bodies because they lost it because they were trying to resurrect their mother, which was clearly impossible to do and they would punish for it. The story is set in 1914 even though people wear clothes that were in the modern day in 2000s. Edward lost his arm and his leg and Al lost his entire body and his soul was put into a metal armour. Later on the “Elric brothers” gets help from the military, their teacher, the emperor’s son and the lady mechanic Winry. So Edward and Al started to train for their journey because they will fight tough enemies, I mean tough. To be honest I like how they wrote this story into a well ordered fashion and you can feel the emotion and tremor in this anime, and the epic battles. To be honest I have never witness a weak character at all or terrible dialogues, thank god for that or this anime would have gotten a little lower rating. But the bad thing about it is how predictable the story was. You can tell that something was bad to happen to the characters, for example if you see a happy moment between somebody, something bad happens to them. Can you believe they made 64 episodes! OMG 64! I thought it was going to be those anime that had a maximum of 25 episodes, there are no fillers.\n",

      "In my opinion the character design sucks, the people in the anime look like characters from the 1990s, I mean look at the characters! To be honest, the characters look chibi and you comparing a three year old to a 35 year-old man there’s no fucking differences! But the art was nice and the animation was fluid, the environment look beautiful and the fights do not look like Naruto Shippuden that the animation sucks balls when they are fighting. Sound there are not much songs in the anime to be honest, I heard about ten which was depressing. Voice acting was great even in the English Dub, but think about this. Hellsing Ultimate’s voice acting of the English Dub was fucking terrible, we all know that, but when compared it to Fullmetal Alchemist, is like comparing the game Last of Us to the game Ride to Hell: Retribution.\n",

Edward is a short little guy that can be very hot tempered and he can be very funny at times, overall he is a very good older brother to Al and he tries his best to protect him. Al his not so as “cool” brother, deeply cares for Edward and he wants to get body back as much as Edward. Winry is a love interest to Edward, she was friends with him since they were little and cares for him as well. Roy Mustang is one of my favourite characters in the anime because he is badass. He has fire power which cannot work when it is raining, “physics.” He partners with his lover Hawkeye which has no ability but she an excellent marksman, even though she is so serious and yet her character design is so unserious. The bad guys in this anime are pretty cool because they are not those bad guys that are just bad for no explanation, they do very evil stuff. The main antagonist Father aka “The bearded bastard” he is like a Xemnas from Kingdom Hearts, he wants the power of God and he is required to sacrifice souls to do that. The bad guys you will hate them because how evil they are, well no shit there the bad guys. I thought the characters were great and the makers put a lot of effort on them. \n",

There was important conversation that made me understand the story more. The characters are pretty amazing. I enjoy almost every bit of the anime, but some points of it was shallow, a bit boring causing me to skip some episodes. I like the characters they keep the show going and make it less boring and dull. The funny moments are hilarious and they will make you laugh. Edward becomes depress and angry when people call him short, but he grows in many episodes later. I love the enjoyment in the anime.\n",

I give praise to the creators for making an awesome anime. I recommend you watch this anime, thank god that they made it.

He despised his dad since the very moment he left his mother to die. Ed loves his brother more than anything else in the world and basically carries Al’s burden for him. His main goal is finding the philosopher's stone and that’s what he would like to do more than anything else in the world, just to give his brother his real body back. Edward began as an immature character, which developed him into a more understanding person as time went on and got a lot of reality checks on the way. At first, Edward made the mistake of thinking alchemy could solve everything, but as time passed that idea faded away and started crumbling, the idea got confirmed once he met Shou Tucker and saw Nina merged with their dog.

Again sung by YUI is a phenomenal opening, amazing story telling, amazing song, amazing visuals and all by all a fantastic opening. It starts out by showing the complete backstory of Ed and Al from Hohenheim's perspective in only just 10 seconds. After that it transitions to a heart bursting in flames which consumes the home of the Elric brothers as they are standing in front of it. In only a few shots you get to take a peek into Al’s head thinking if he will become human again. It has a shot of Maes Hughes and Roy Mustang covering each others’ backs but once Mustang turns around he looks horrified, indicating Hughes’ death.Its got great compositions, and even amazing action scenes. This opening truly is one of the best openings of all time.\n",

Even though the rain is supposed to wash it away, all of the characters are still covered in dirt and blood. And the city is covered in flames.

      "Directed by Yasuhiro Irie and produced by studio BONES, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a 64 episode adaptation of  Hiromu Arakawa‘s original manga and a tangential successor to 2003’s ‘Fullmetal Alchemist‘. Heralded by many to be one of the greatest anime of all time, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ (hereupon referenced simply as ‘Brotherhood‘) could be considered a ‘rite of passage’ into the depths of anime fandom and/or the anime ‘sphere’ in general by many an anime fan. Thus, three years following my traipse into the world of anime, I approached this beast tenuously and left with my emotions and opinions varied. Did I like ‘Brotherhood‘? Yes,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "quite a lot in fact. Is it the greatest anime of all time? Not by a long shot. The following review will take into account the factors of story, animation, sound and characters, each component ultimately attributing to a final score. Note that this review is entirely subjective (thought it attempts on the whole to be as objective as possible) and I welcome  open discussion in the comments below…\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Story – 8/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The initial story of 'Brotherhood' is by and large very simple: two brothers set out on a journey to fulfil their goal(s) and encounter many obstacles along the way. Indeed, everything that occurs during the course of the 64 episodes could be seen as 'yet another' obstacle preventing the Elric brothers from achieving their goals and I believe this is where 'Brotherhood's story shines: a typical shounen presents the viewer  with the main character and their goal(s), e.g. Naruto and his ambition to be Hokage, Luffy and his search for the One Piece, etc. A good or great  shounen presents the viewer with the latter whilst proffering a story that doesn't feel like a buffer and content that doesn't appear a preventative measure taken in order to elongate the shounen (an issue that to this day has prevented me from finishing 'Dragon Ball Z'). In this sense 'Brotherhood' is an astounding success: everything that occurs - every arc, every character introduction, every seemingly misplaced scene - contributes in some way to the shows larger, overarching story, blending into a whirlwind final set of episodes that leave the viewer in awe of the anime's scope and the writers vision. Coherence and a fulfilling culmination in a series longer than 50 episodes is a feat in and of itself, never mind the fact that said story is both gripping and enthralling. For 64 episodes, the viewer and the characters alike are left to follow a trail of breadcrumbs, minor story details that are just enough to keep the viewer satisfied till the next 'big' expository plot-point, leading to a conclusion that delivers on its promise of a full loaf (my apologies, time to stop with bread analogies...) and then some! Even the chemistry, physics and biology of the 'Brotherhood' world were interesting, alchemy being a well developed concept in its own right, bar a few 'it's an anime' misgivings...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All that taken into account, I suppose a question must then arise: why only an 8? 'Brotherhood' is 'deep', philosophical, waxes and wanes poetic and hell - it even resolves battle sequences in the 21 minutes within which they begin (I'm glaring at you, 'Dragon Ball Z'...)! But there are several issues - minor niggles - that mire an attempt at otherwise cohesive storytelling: the presentation of thematic issues, the inconsistent tone and a flat, uninspired ending. 'Show don't tell' is a literary technique employed to allow experience through subjective observation rather than objective exposition: one of the minor issues I had with 'Brotherhood' stemmed from it's presentation of it's thematic issues, it's almost dogmatic preaching of them and it's over reliance on a didactic formula, harbouring no trust in the audience to draw their own conclusions - an irksome 'flaw' that cropped up on occasion and left me rolling my eyes once too often. 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' was and is the epitome of 'show don't tell' done well and all too often 'Brotherhood', in spite of it's 17+ rating, falls into the rut of 'typical shounen' and speaks to its audience as though they are children, leaving an unsavoury taste once the initial digest in complete.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My second issue - and the most 'distasteful' - is that of the show's inconsistent tone. From the offset, 'Brotherhood' is dark and gritty and whilst humour on occasion is not at all unwelcome (and is often done well within the shows 64 episodes), the constant inundation of poorly timed 'jokes' and attempts at humour draws the audience out of any semblance of immersion they may once have had. For example - and a minor spoiler here for those of you who want to go in completely unspoiled - there is a female character in the show who, like the Elric brothers, has committed alchemical taboo. She loses her ability to have children and other organs as a result and during the course of the show - for comedic effect - constantly and consistently vomits blood, a running gag that is neither funny nor appropriate given that this happens only moments after her immersive 'back-story' is presented to the audience. This level of inconsistency is strange and spoils an otherwise totally immersive experience, again, leaving me only to roll my eyes as yet another serious moment is concluded with yet another cliché gag... That said, the constant mocking of Mustang's inability to use fire alchemy when it rained was never unwelcome, poor wet matchstick that he was.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My final gripe - and it is a minor one - is that of the ending which is at once fulfilling and yet leaves something to be desired. I can't obviously divulge too much without meandering into spoiler territory, however I can say that - on a positive note - all of the major and minor plot points are tied up: nothing is really left to the imagination (minor romantic interests aside). My problem however, was its simplicity - a level of happiness that did not entirely befit the shows thematic aspirations. I'll leave it at that and to you, the viewers discretion to decide whether or not the ending was entirely satisfactory, but I digress...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Characters - 7.5/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are another major selling point in 'Brotherhood' the quality and development of even some of the minor characters leaving me in amazement. Each character is more than a cliché or a trope; the dynamics between them leaves a lasting impression on the audiences that causes the latter to care for each individual far more than in most anime, leading to a roller-coaster of thrills and frights as each character edges closer to and overcomes various threats, both seen and unseen. I think it's also important to note that characters do die in 'Brotherhood', that 'Game of Thrones', 'Attack on Titan'-esk quality that makes them so popular and so addictive. Even the various antagonists are developed enough that, when/if they die, the viewer is left feeling emotionally conflicted, contrary to the expected feelings of overwhelming satisfaction. I do feel however - and this is my only gripe, major though it is - that some characters are more developed than others (one word away from an 'Animal Farm' reference there...): characters who are developed to a greater extent in 2003's rendition are often times less so in 2009's adaptation and this unbalanced approach to character development has multiplex effects on an anime that would have otherwise flawless characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Take the character Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong (a full title awarded here for emphasis): what purpose does she serve other than to be the 'bad-ass female'? She's angry, she's broody, she hates her wimpy brother...and that, dear viewers, is all the show has to offer from the good Major. Compare her to Mustang or even Winry and one begins to see that a character who is prevalent for at least most of the shows latter half pales in comparison to even the main characters love interest! Lust, whose character development truly pales in comparison to her 2003 counterpart, is relegated to the role of the mere and simple villain, a character development crime if I've ever seen one. The main villain(!) who is seen only fleetingly throughout the show till his back-story is fully divulged elicits no greater reaction than acknowledgement and at worst negligible sympathy, paling again in comparison to the shows other, 'minor', antagonists... It's a shame, really, one the deducted from my enjoyment of the show and one the forces me to give the shows characters a good, but borderline average rating... And don't even get me started of Alfonse and his good damn apple pie (which, might I add, we never see him eat!).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Animation - 7/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In any anime over 24 episodes there are going to be animation issues. Don't misunderstand me, 'Brotherhood's animation is at almost all times 'good', edging towards at the very least 'very good', but I was never truly impressed. Colours are often flat and uninteresting and character designs somewhat strange (e.g. Edward's telly-tubby-esk strand of hair and Mustang's overly-round head...) and on occasion the background details leave something to be desired. That said, 'Brotherhood's animation is almost always crisp and battle sequences are vibrant, detailed and enthralling - fundamental necessities when one considers that we are dealing with alchemy (i.e. magic). As the show progresses and the scale of battles increases, not only does the animation remain as detailed above, it actually increases in quality, giving those final battles the extra umph required to making them that much more interesting and that much more intense. There's not much more to be said of the animation other than that its quality stand on par with the shows quality - and there's not much more you can ask for from a shounen now, is there?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Sound - 7/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'll be honest: a part from a few select tracks, I didn't entirely notice 'Brotherhood's soundtrack... It was satisfying and valuable, don't misunderstand what I'm saying, however, in moments without tension or on such an epic scale, 'Brotherhood's soundtrack becomes simply ambient noise. 'Sound' quality is of course one of the more difficult categories to rate as ones enjoyment of an anime's soundtrack is fundamentally and entirely subjective: my favourite opening was the first and my favourite ending was the fourth, however, that said, I've spoken with others who've watch this anime and whose opinions differed entirely from my own to both extremes. Ultimately, in my opinion, it was good, however I leave it for you, the reader, to decide whether or not you enjoy it. If at this point the story and characters alone are enough to interest you, then I suggest you go and watch 'Brotherhood' now; the soundtrack is complimentary and will only add to your enjoyment of the show. That said, it's not one that I would personally go out and buy...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Conclusion]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a great anime, one that anyone who calls themselves an anime ‘fan’ must watch at least once in their life and one that will be spoken about for years to come. A compelling and cohesive story, with excellent characters, impressive thematic breadth and crisp, clean animation that is pleasant to the eye, ‘Brotherhood‘ excels as one of the greatest shounen offerings to date and – best of all – it has no filler! A miracle if I ever did see one. In all honesty, I’d recommended – if you have the time/the patience – watching the original 2003 anime first, if only to see character development in characters who severely lacked it in this rendition. And to my overall enjoyment… Despite several flaws in the presentation of an otherwise wonderful story and lopsided character development… I loved almost every minute with this complicated and personable cast whose stories (bar a few…) ended beautifully and whose presence is still felt, long after having finished the show – and if that’s not the sign of a good anime, I don’t know what is…\n",

      "Look, FMAB is an epic tale. I really enjoy watching it, but there is just something that really disappoints me every time I watch another episode: The pacing is too damn fast!

      " I loved the first series: FMA. Even though the plot was different there were so many more moments that really captivated me emotionally! But I couldn't feel any of this in FMAB...They could easily have made 100 episodes without one single filler, but somehow\n",

      "As a manga, Fullmetal Alchemist was met with resounding popularity right from the start, and after only two years of it’s ten year run, the demand for an anime adaptation was overwhelming. Studio Bones took up the production, but with the manga not even a quarter of the way finished, they were left with a pretty big lemon to deal with. Fortunately, they were able to make lemonade by writing an entirely new story using the material they were given. The resulting anime was an immediate success, among fans and critics alike, winding up on more than it’s fair share of top ten lists since\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "then. And yet, despite the fact that it was universally loved and critically acclaimed across the board, there was still heavy demand for a more faithful adaptation. Thus, in 2009, only one year away from the manga’s end, Brotherhood was born.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From an animation standpoint, this show was working with a relatively low budget. This is nothing new, of course... Japanese animation has always used a lower frame rate than American animation, and often look cheaper as a result. Low budgets are fairly common, but what really differentiates is how different shows manage their budgets. By using key frames, speed lines and other useful tricks, you can cut corners where it won’t be noticed, and save your money for the moments that need to move more fluidly. If you do this well, most audiences will never notice the difference. The original series was incredibly good at this, but unfortunately, Brotherhood is not. The key frames are a lot more blatant, as frozen heads can move their lips for several seconds at a time while people in the background just sort of freeze into bluish blobs.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rarely ever complain about an anime‘s artwork, as it’s rarely ever a problem for me, but it has to be said... Brotherhood’s artwork is lazy. It is plagued by choppy, jagged outlines. You may not notice it in far shots, but whenever any character has a close-up, it can’t be avoided. The only exception, that I’ve seen, is with it’s openings.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While we’re on the subject of openings, me gusta.  They are all spectacular.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the English dub, let’s keep this brief. It is every bit as good as the original’s. There are a few changes made, but none of them are bad, and yes, Maxey Whitehead deserves to have a statue built in her honor.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, with all that out of the way, let’s talk about what really matters... The story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I first decided to try out this series, a friend of mine warned me that the first few episodes were basically a rehash of the material from the first anime. What she failed to mention is that by a few episodes, she meant the first thirteen, and by rehash, she basically meant cliff notes. Brotherhood gets off to a horrible start, pushing out a pointless Ice-Alchemist episode purely for the sake of fan-service before moving onto the rest of the rushed material. 26 episodes are crammed into thirteen episodes, and by god it feels like it. The pacing is jarringly terrible, the stories are rushed, we get barely any background material devoted to the Elric brothers’ childhood, and key moments of their past are told to us rather than shown to us.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Example:  Remember how a certain piece of Winry’s backstory was revealed to us in FMA? We opened on Winry, as a child, crying her eyes out at the table while taking her anger out on the boys. Not only were her actions genuinely and believably child like, but it gave serious insight into Pinako’s distaste for the military, and foreshadowed the fate of Trisha Elric. How was this key plot point revealed in Brotherhood? Winry sat next to Hawkeye and told her about it. No emotional impact, just exposition. And that’s just one example. Show, don’t tell, people. This is basic stuff here.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the biggest problems with the anime is shown right off the bat during these episodes, and never really goes away. From a dramatic standpoint, Brotherhood suffers greatly at the hands of it’s own poorly timed gag humor. Some of the most deep, emotional moments of the series get their serious tone blown away by ugly, unfunny super-deformed moments. Even when the boys are lying on the ground in pieces after an encounter with Scar, they still can’t escape this.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In any case, once this little catch-up session is over, the story starts to get a lot better. The pacing finally becomes bearable, as bold new ideas... At least they’re new to those of us who haven’t read that far into the manga... Are introduced. Familiar characters like Kimblee, Scar and Dr. Marco wear out their welcome, but at the same time, a flurry of compelling characters are introduced. Ling Yao, Lan Fan, and May Chang are outstanding, and their arrival placed a stamp of individuality on the show that it frankly didn’t have until then. We’re introduced to the country of Xing and the practice of alkahestry, two concepts that never stop being interesting.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certain characters sorely missed, but not so much that we can’t appreciate the presence of Olivier Armstrong, one of the most captivating characters in the entire franchise. A small selection of characters are actually handled and developed better than they were in the original show, with a few examples being Riza Hawkeye and Envy. Some interesting ideas are explored through Gluttony, but I still miss his puppy-dog loyalty to Lust.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a high point that goes on for a very long time.  To be honest, for a very long stretch of episodes in the middle, I was seriously considering giving this series a solid 8, but then there's the ending... An ending went so far over the top with it's sickeningly happy Disney resolutions that I had to knock it down a point.  I can't really talk about it without giving away spoilers, but this show goes so far to have all good guys win and all bad guys lose that some of the resolutions are just insultingly stupid.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All in all, this series was quite disappointing. The first thing anybody says to promote it is that it's faithful to the original manga, but that often feels like more of a restriction than an advantage. With fans world-wide clamoring about it being a masterpiece, I had high expectations for it. It’s not better... Not by a long shot. It never reaches the depth or complexity of the original, but as a stand-alone, it’s still a pretty decent show. It’s got some serious, jarring flaws, but it still brings to life an exciting fantasy adventure that fans of all ages can enjoy.\n",

Story has sweet romance aswell, I would've literally killed for a kiss at the end atleast but oh well, still trust me you will love it, it will make you blush :3.

The pace flowed perfectly throughout each episode, adding both drama, suspense, comedy, and even some hidden romance. The theme was clearly stated at the beginning as \"Brotherhood\", of course, but also love, family, friendship, acceptance, and even sacrifice. There were no fillers unlike the original, and everything connected perfectly like a puzzle piece. I found no cliche bits, and felt they established the \"normal\" very early on this time.

Even Al changed with his little hair piece was enough.\n",

I do think Vic did a better job on this one then the last because he knew the character more the second time around.

What I really liked though was the effects of objects created with alchemy. The characters often created objects with alchemy that had uneven patterns. At first I thought it was strange, then I figured out that it was a brilliant idea as it allowed you to distinguish the difference between some objects created with alchemy and objects that were created through other means.\n",

      "The voices of the Japanese cast was very good. I never felt annoyed by their voices. One of the problems with this series is that the music was never something memorable for me. I remember the events and the characters of the story, but the music was always something that was in the background that I never took notice of. The sound matches nicely with the events and do not feel awkward at least.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters were great in this series and many of them were well developed. Nearly all of the major characters receive some sort of flashback that tells you more about them without killing them off. This helped a lot in the development of characters and establishing the atmosphere and motivations of characters in the series. It was done very well compared to some of the other series out there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I felt that this series was pretty good for a Shounen series. Considering the amount of brainless overpowered main characters out there, this was one of the few that strayed a little from that formula in order to give us something different. Though the characters do suffer from a tragic past, the main characters rarely beat their opponents through brute force and willpower. We learn a lot about the primary villain and numerous characters receive a fair amount of screen time that helps develop the characters further.\n",
      "After watching the original fma you are filled with dread with the thought have they managed to muck up a classic the answer NO.

      "Hiromu Arakawa's Fullmetal Alchemist is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It is larger than life yet deeply personal. It touches on loss, the meaning of life, cultural diversity, the dangers of science, Nazism, the Iraq war, and the list goes on. Arakawa seamlessly weaves so coherent a story from such divergent threads that it mirrors the skill of a first-rate novelist. She is a brilliant world-builder and her characters are exceptional.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For instance, Arakawa's representation of women breaks with convention. There are strong, independent women like Izumi Curtis, Riza Hawkeyes, and Olivia Armstrong. These characters are complex and unique, as one can\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "notice from each character's distinct source of independence – confidence (Izumi), resolve (Hawkeyes), and leadership (Armstrong). There are tenderhearted mothers like Gracia Hughes and Trisha Elric; and those who cannot be captured by such umbrella terms like Winry Rockbell, Maria Ross, and May Chang. I suppose it's only natural for Japan's most successful female mangaka to embody such an ambitious project – to portray the totality of womanhood: thèse, antithèse, et synthèse. Furthermore, she gives plenty of time and space to include the backstory of every character. None of them has an uninteresting backstory and they all somehow play key roles in this mysterious world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite the presence of alchemy, the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is very similar to ours. It is full of racism, hatred, war, greed, love, compassion, and courage. Alchemy is used as a metaphor for power, knowledge, and science. It seems magical at first, but one soon realizes that its rules cannot be bended much like the laws of nature. Even though they have such a powerful tool, we keep encountering those who wish to go beyond its limits. Alchemy is, arguably, a reflection of our weakness. As the philosopher Julian Savulescu noted, humans are much better at solving abstract problems than learning how to work together as a whole. Edward's final decision in the show alludes to Arakawa's message that we do not need to rely on knowledge and science to lead a meaningful life. Instead, we need to accept the human condition. Similar to Aristotle's notion of the Good Life, Ed and Al choose to pursue virtues like friendship, altruism, humility, and compassion. Humanity was not meant to know everything, and the human condition bids us to focus on the Good rather than the Truth. It appears that Arakawa is a pragmatist– knowledge is useful insofar as it is practical.\n",

Those who have seen the first FMA series could guess how sad the loss of a beloved character can be. Besides the heartbreaking stuff the story delves deep in to the workings of alchemy in ways that the first series didn't come close to emulating. The series climax is action packed and emotionally charged (might I remind you to watch this in Japanese again? ^-^ ) like the first series but the end to this series is on a more epic scale.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Watching this series really did feel rewarding for me, as I watched the characters develop, I felt like I was becoming friends with them and was sharing in their triumphs and folleys. I felt like I had been on an adventure myself by the time I was through, and if you have yet to see this I wish you well on your adventure!\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMA:B) is a masterpiece, consistently voted as one of the best anime series and also as one of the best tv series of all time this amazing show definitely deserves those titles.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story line of FMA:B is complex but understandable, it hits hard with some good old fashioned feels but it's also incredibly delicate and fine tuned which leaves you stunned for hours after the final credits roll.\n",

      "But where I believe Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood really shines is in it's characters and the character development. Protagonist and antagonist alike are easy to fall in love with, each and every character feels unique and has there own strengths and weaknesses, no two characters are alike. The people in this show have there own original personalities and these all evolve beautifully over the span of the show, the like of which I have never seen before. The characters and the development of them cannot be understated in FMA:B\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In terms as to why I wouldn't give it a 10, I'd say mainly because there are area's it could have done better. The art quality could have been more distinct and original... the music could have been improved a bit to give it more presence... The fighting could have been more Hunter X Hunter style and focus more\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist fans are a lucky bunch. Not only did they score one television anime based (for the most part) on Hiromu Arakawa's amazing manga series, but the same studio who made that one, Bones, decided to later do an even longer series based even closer to the manga. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was one of those things that I thought was just going to be summarily dismissed as a novelty for the manga readers. I personally didn't care whether there was an accurate version of the manga in anime form. I loved (and still love) the first series and movie, and if I want the\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "manga's story, I can read the manga. Fortunately, Brotherhood was damn good enough to keep watching from beginning to end, and it isn't necessarily because this show is significantly superior to the first (it isn't at all), but because it's just a very good show in itself. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, basically, the story is a quest of restoration. The Elric brothers lost their bodies and are looking for a way to regain those things. The journey of the Elrics takes them to various places, meeting various people, and with various plot twists and turns, ultimately leading them to the final confrontation with said Big Bad, and somehow regaining (most of) what they lost. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "My one objection to the treatment of the narrative is that, much like in the original manga, it relies on these big sensational \"moments\", which are cool to read/watch, but ultimately take away from the verisimilitude of the work as a whole. All you end up getting are a bunch of puncuations that take away from the subtlety of the themes. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the most part, we get a variety of interesting, and examined characters. The short-tempered but honest Edward and his more composed brother Alphonse. The ambitious and snarky Roy Mustang. His loyal subordinates. The over-the-top, larger-than-life Alex Louis Armstrong and his vicious, tough-as-nails older sister, Olivier Mira Armstrong. The affable, but wicked Greed (my favorite character). The king of trolls, Envy. The badassery-oozing-from-every-pore King Bradley. The adorable May. The butt monkey Yoki. The distant father with the weight of the world on his shoulders, Hohenheim. Some great characters. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art and animation in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is pretty good, and what one would expect of an anime of this generation. The character designs are much closer to Hiromu Arakawa's art in Brotherhood than they were in the original series. The backgrounds and foregrounds can be quite beautiful, if oddly like watercolor paintings at times.The animation is mostly pretty good, though there are times when it noticeably isn't, and it's pretty clear certain episodes have a much higher quality animation than others. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "A large part of bringing the characters alive in an animated television series or movie is the voice acting. In the manga, you just imagine the voices, but in animation, voices are provided, and ideally, these are voices that you will closely associate with the characters, so a strong cast is valuable. Fortunately, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has an excellent cast.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The music in this series is excellent. Senju makes use of sprawling, almost pastoral, European-sounding tracks, establishing leitmotifs and conjuring up very operatic pieces for the most dramatic moments in the series.\n",

      "It's not a flawless series, mind you. It seems overly drawn out at times, there are a few plot snags, some characters I don't care for, and adaptation missteps (Dublith/Greed arc, the Ishbal massacre). But, on the whole, looking at the big picture, it's absolutely more than just the sum of its parts\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an amazing anime that deserves the praises that it is associated with. One of the main reasons to why I've rated this anime as a 10 is due to its realistic preferences. this is shown symbolically as \"alchemy\". Alchemy is made out to be the first law of thermodynamics in a less abstract form (how energy cannot be created nor destroyed). Then by merging the religious aspect that we see in real life, it not for a clash of ideals like what see in our society but an almost perfect utopia for religion and science coexisting with each other\n",

Two boys lose their bodies trying to bring back their mother so they try to get it back by studying alchemy. Easy, right. but there's so much more to FMA Brotherhood then just getting some bodies back. As this anime goes into more detail the viewer realizes everything in this anime works together\n",

      "Before I watched FMA I had no idea that there existed an anime company called Bones. Now I do and whatever they release I watch. Something special about Bones is their animation. The animation for FMA Brotherhood is meant to be the way it is. Bones did an amazing job in figuring out what works in this anime. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a lot of different sounds in FMA Brotherhood. Some of them are repetitive, especially in fight scenes, but they never get old. There is also a lot of older types of music in this anime like 1930's jazz and waltz. \n",

      "Ed and Al are your main characters in this anime and if you watch this anime you will like either Ed or Al or both. I haven't met a person yet that hates both of them. Other character like Roy Mustang are also very amusing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For me the enjoyment factor in this anime was great. I couldn't wait for the next episode to come out so I can watch it. I'm sure if your a person that loves shounen you will love this anime. And if your looking for an anime that is really in depth and is fast paced then you should definitely give this anime a go.\n",
      "Unpopular opinion: First FMA series is better than Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sorry, everyone. It started off good, but then I became blatantly bored. It aimed towards younger audiences than the first series in my opinion.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "News flash: Just because it follows the manga, doesn't mean it's better than the first anime series. And it's not. It had a lot of childish comedy, which is usually no big deal, but I was annoyed. Some of the characters that were in Brotherhood really bothered me. Guess I preferred the \"Seven Deadly\" Homunculi in the first series to this one as well.\n",
      "\r\n",

FMA will always be one of my favorite stories, just not the one I prefer. I would still recommend watching Brotherhood to anyone and I still give it a good score because it was a good series.\n",
      "I can understand the conflict between how Fullmetal Alchemist and FMA Brotherhood in which they differ. However, although there may be a different opinion among those who have taken the time to watch both of the series, but I personally believe that enrichment in the FMAB series of 64 episodes is superior to the older dramatized FMA series. In my full understanding I can say that my opinion won't change for the simple fact I have enjoyed watching Brotherhood twice over with subtitles and once again in dubbed version for a full story in mind. All in all, the basis of the show is in\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Indeed this series does have a repetition in its theoretical story and action, but the character life seems all too real. This show definitely is my favorite at this point, but even in that light, I still have just one issue. Characters take quick risks and life changing actions for emotions of past beloved people or wish it so, but never do they feel to me that they are attached until the rap up of the story. So if you are for swift feels, then you should realize that you need to complete the entirety of the story. \n",

      "I myself was hesitant about it. the first few episodes were almost the same as the original and i had almost dropped it but around episode 15 if i recall right. Brotherhood kicks it up and takes on a different story then the original. A much better one. If you watch one episode you'll keep watching.\n",

Not knowing any better, he used MAL's rating system of popularity and scores to choose what he thought were the best of the best. He struck gold several times with gems like Steins;Gate but also found stones with deceiving luster and zero value like Toradora. However, it was not until a year after he began his journey\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As the highest rated series on MAL, I had some expectations for this show even though MAL scores don't mean that much. I have not seen the original FMA or read the manga, but after watching FMAB, I don't really plan to. FMAB is just a nice show to binge if you have nothing better to do.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pros\r\n",
      "There are really no glaring flaws with the show. The plot was engaging for the first third and decent for the the rest. All the major characters have interesting traits and backgrounds. The art style is unique, and the animation is solid for the most part. The OST is pretty good.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cons\r\n",
      "Even though the show has no low points, there are really no real high points ever. It's kinda of just a flatline for a majority of it. If someone were to ask me \"What's your favorite part of FMAB?\", I'd literally say nothing. Everything is serviceable. It checked off all the marks for the most crowd pleasing show. It is a longish shounen show, but I don't think that's really an excuse. HxH isn't my favorite show of all time or even a personal favorite, but at least I can say I really enjoyed some of the fights and a few characters. In FMAB, I can't say that. I would assume many people would respond, \"What do you mean? I loved everything about FMAB! Everything about that show is perfect!\" But after like ep 20 or something, I just wanted it to end. The main antagonist is kinda dull, the fight scenes are ok, the themes are fairly generic, the comedy is just there for the sake of comedic relief and not actually funny, and in general, everything is kinda just there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To re-clarify, this show is definitely not bad. But does something with no flaws immediately make it a masterpiece? Definitely not. I'm sure if you're actually reading this and debating whether to watch FMAB, you'll might just watch it out of curiosity like I did. And if you love it to death, then great! But for me, it was just an ok and ultimately forgettable show.\n",
      "The original Fullmetal Alchemist anime was one of the first anime series I ever watched. I remember seeing glimpses of it when I was younger, but the story did not pull me in or appeal to me as much as Inuyasha did at the time. It was years later, when I was thirteen, that I finally did watch it and I fell in love. However, at the time, I didn't have much to compare it to, having never read the manga. When I heard that Brotherhood was coming out, I rushed off to read the manga and got up-to-date with it before Brotherhood started and\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "continued to stay up-to-date on both the manga and Brotherhood. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two years after these have both ended, I have re-watched the series several times, and every time I rewatch it, it never loses any appeal nor do I ever find any serious faults with it. It's a wonderful story of love and loss, pain and grief, family and friendship and put together, it makes for a very touching and compelling story about two brothers who attempt to make the best of a situation they brought on themselves by performing human transmutation as well as regain what they have lost as a result. Coupled with a wide variety of characters, all amazing in their own way, it makes for a truly amazing tale that can have you laughing one moment and crying the next. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I've read many conflicting views on both series; some say there was little to no character development in Brotherhood as compared to the original, others say Brotherhood moved too fast and wasn't as a deep of a story. I personally prefer Brotherhood to the original and here is why:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Edward Elric seems a lot more grown up in Brotherhood. In the original (now that I've seen Brotherhood and can compare the two), he is a bit whiny and annoying. My personal favorite character is the homunculus Envy, as disliked of a character he is, I believe he is a much deeper and well-developed character than he is given credit for in both series. Brotherhood's storyline seems much more thought-out and in the end, it has a much deeper message than the original. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first few episodes of Brotherhood are covering what happened in the original up to the point where it diverged from the manga and while it is rushed, I was okay with it because I wouldn't want to sit through ~30 episodes of stuff I have already seen. I feel that even though it was rushed, it got the story across just as effectively, not to mention it left more room for the plot to unfold and progress at a more natural pace. I also think the animation is lot better and more appealing to look at. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story has a great ending whereas with the original, you had to watch the movie Conqueror of Shamballa to get some real closure. I do believe that some characters in Brotherhood were killed off too soon and could have received more character development - a particular homunculus being a prime example, if you've seen the anime already I'm pretty sure you'll know who but I'm trying not to be spoilery.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in the end, I wholeheartedly believe Brotherhood far surpasses the original and the original hardly even compares. I recommend that everyone watches both, but don't be surprised if you end up preferring Brotherhood.\n",
      "This is probably an actual enjoyable anime in a way the story was pretty alright kind of mediocre compared to my expectations the only solution to which it may be able to reach the requirements of my expectations is if they added a little bit more unpredicatbility some plot twists and thickening and then it will probably reach atleast a 5. The animation was pretty poor only 1 good fight and the art as was not my cup of tea. The characters are not hot at all and sometimes kind of stupid. The sound design is basic and bland too and the overall anime was\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "below mid. Very overrated\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Conclusion: Probably a good anime for normies but true anime enthusiasts wouldn't appreciate something like this. I would only recommend this to my 3 year old brother\n",
      "Before watching this anime i hadn't watched any other anime's, so I had nothing to compare it to. But after watching the first episode i was immediately hooked and couldn't get enough.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is fantastic leaving you wanting to see more. It also doesn't give too much away too quickly leaving the viewer excited to find out what will happen next. The characters are also easily liked and they all added to the experience. As for the art style it didn't look outdated and sound was used carefully.\n",

I loved the story, which was amazingly original and had a very good moral (which I find important). The Characters are original and have great development. There just wasn't a single character I found truly annoying. Edward has become my favorite anime character. The music is really good, although I did miss Tsuisou (Kyoudai/Bratja) from FMA. I loved FMA too, but thought that the story became a little random towards the end. I never had this feeling with Brotherhood, because everything I didn't\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This is the premise of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I feel that I should take the time right now to establish a few key points about this review. Brotherhood's English dub has not been fully released yet, and I do not generally enjoy watching a series in Japanese for various reasons. That said, while I did watch the latter half of Brotherhood in Japanese, I won't comment on the Japanese voice actors; I do not understand the language enough to truly grasp the emotion and meaning set behind actual words, and the only thing I have to go off of is the fansub group's interpretation of what characters were saying.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about Brotherhood. The plot of the show spans so many characters that it's a testament to the ability of the writers that they were able to keep consistency throughout the astounding and wonderful plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show takes place in a fictional nation called Amestris, a place fully realized from top to bottom. Every territory's similarities to one another, and their differences, are intricately designed, and conveyed through actions, visuals, and dialogue, without ever being explicitly stated or exposited. But not just Amestris; at least two other nations are given screen time, and even one nation we never actually see, are conveyed as so different from Amestris, and yet it's clear that they're all in the same world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Setting is great, but the characters are what make Brotherhood truly shine. I could go on about each of them individually, probably for hours on end. Each and every supporting character has their own story told, without ever dragging or detracting from the main plot of the series. Everything is woven together seamlessly, from beginning to end. The viewer is in the dark for most of the villain's plans and doings for most of the series, but by the end, it all makes perfect sense, and again, this is achieved without ever having the villains simply go on a ten minute monologue explaining everything.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every minute of the series is spent developing characters, advancing the plot, and showing the audience what they should know when they should know it, all at the same time. Even the slowest parts of the series are kept fascinating throughout.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The English dub is being produced by FUNimation, with most of the VAs from the original Full Metal Alchemist series reprising their roles. At the time of writing this review, the English dub is not yet complete, and there are still some characters yet to be voiced, but from the first thirty-nine episodes, unless everyone absolutely drops the ball for the latter half of the show, I am confident in saying that the dub is fantastic. Every character is brought to life through a combination of excellent writing and acting, and it's difficult to tell which of the two is doing more to make them believable.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mood and tone are very important in that as well. From all the praise I've been giving the series so far, it should come as no surprise that the soundtrack is beautifully composed and employed exquisitely.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything I've mentioned so far has been fantastic. So what about the low points of the series? What's done poorly? Nothing at all. Every plot thread culminates into something spectacular, no character is forgotten, and everything else is simply amazing. The only real criticism I could think of for the series is that \"science\" basically means \"magic,\" but even that doesn't detract from the series being astounding.\n",

Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn't focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There's Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There's Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime's most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening's singer. Plotwise, there isn't a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.\n",

      "Like I've already said in some of my other review, I'm not at my best, when I'm reviewing something, that I like... or love, for that matter! Maybe because, when you usually review something you love, you tend to overhype it, drooling all over it, like a rapid dog, and when someone, like me, tends to take that overhyping for granted, it can really, really easily backfire. To me, it's just so much more easier to say, why I hate something, rathen than why I love, but if I have to tell, why I love something, it's usually just something like \"meh... because!\" Not very\n",

      "The story - in a nutshell, because there's a lot! - is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse, who study alchemy, since their deadbeat-father left them out of nowhere, without mentioning when or never to return. Their mother dies, so logically, they try to bring her back... which would be all and good, if it wasn't such a taboo! So big of a taboo in fact, that the older brother looses his arm and a leg, and the other his entire body - symbolism, everywhere! With no other choise left but to \"stand up and go further\", they burn down their house, join in the military, and start their hunt in search of a legendary Philosophers stone, that can in any hands do pretty much anything, even beyond the laws of nature, equivalent exchange, or even the God himself! All in the same time, when the military and the mysterious group of renegades called Homunculi plot their way up in the circles, all waiting the Promised Day to arrive, and end the world as they know it! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What is the secret behind the Philosopher's stone, and the Isvalan civil war? What is this Promised Day, and what it means to be called a \"sacrivice\"? Who plots against who and who stands to gain immortality? All this and more, in about 60-episodes- long rollercoaster of deceat, vengeance, and hope for a happy ending!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I first saw this anime, I've already seen the \"original\" older version, and didn't like it... as much! I thought it was clumsy, little jumpy with the story department, and the characters... well, they were there. That's all. Nothing really solid there, but I won't complain. Overall, I wasn't that hyped, to see this newer, bigger and more costly \"remake\", that's supposed to follow the original manga much more loyally... and knowing, what the remakes usually do to our beloved movies, this could've been really big hit or miss! Lucky for me... I really loved it! The story really was great, with deeper themes, following so many sidestories, characters' backstories and motivations, that I actually felt like drowning into everyhting, that I was exposed to... and this anime is only about 60 episodes long! God damn!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I was so impressed about this anime, whas that it actually was relatively deep, both for a story, and the characters, and do I even dare to say... somewhat complex at a times - it took me actually three rewaches to get a good grip of the sidestories, main plot, and motivations, understandin fully every single character, and what they're \"mind-frames\" really were! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "That being said, the plot itself is still relatively simple, but the way it's told, is not! There are so many elements, and plotpoints, that it's almost hard to tell, where the actual story is, and when do all these little pieces get put together - like a awesome 3D-puzzle! But, when it does get put together, it's just so satisfactory, that it feels like... well, it feels! Questions about live and death, teology and humans' real place in the world, what you can wish for, and what you can actually have, without breaking the boundaries you're not granted to brake, what's the true price of desires, and is there really some things in this world, that should stay forbidden, untainted by humans greedy hands? These are just a scrach on the surface of many, many themes this anime has to offer, and I can't wait, to find out even more!\n",

      "The art... while still not my strongest forte in my judgement-stand-point, is still pretty impressive, and pretty to look at. The backgrounds are clear and simple, yet immaginative enough to belong into this steam-punk- ish, so-so historic version of Germany in WWII, which really was a big selling-point for me, who just absolutely loves history.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are all simple, yet easy too tell apart. They don't all have the same faces, nor all-too-similar facial expressions, which seems to be my new pet peeve in anime in regular. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fights - yes, there's fighting involved in this anime... surprise! - are very detailed and the animation compiments beautifully each characters own personalities, abilities and what are their strongest points. For example, Ed is pretty talented fighter in general, but tends to \"overheat\" if being called \"shortie\". Al is much more composed, but too gentle most of the times. The homunculi are my absolute favourite to watch, since they all have different abilites, and they all use them with precise, and with deadly talent, that's just a bliss to look at!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are still easily seen some brief, yet noticeable moments of changed animation styles, expecially during fighting. The movements tend to lack the same fluidity as it normally has, and be thus overly exaggerated, but those are just a very brief moments here and there, mostly in the second half of the series, so it gets a pass from me.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The characters - and o'boy there are tons! - aren't just some easy stereotypes, or shallow cardboard cut-outs, with little to no personality, or no actual motivations. These are real people, with real desires, flaws and sins to bear, with deep emotions and motivations, both in good and in bad. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the best part is, that it's not just the story, that gets to know them, but also we, who get to hear their thoughts, their memories and ambitions in life, like if they're talking with us, and I just love, when characters do that! You see their backstories, you hear their thoughts, their reasonings for their actions, and their points of views about situations, siding either with them, or against them. None of them are crystal clear, or pure white, and often times, I felt like watching actual real-life people, dealing with their pasts, sins, desires and flaws, rather than some fictional characters, bound in some unexplained contraption of plotpoints and events. They took their time to talk to me, to show me sides of themselves that I didn't know of, or didn't really want to learn of... but that's human for you - we all have sides in ourselves, that are both beautiful, and ugly, because we have something, called dimensions! These characters know both their own, and each others flaws, strenghts, ambitions and sins, therefore acting like a real individuals, being either hero, or a villain! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And since we're already in the subject, I may as well say a thing or two about the... romances, in this anime. Yes, there're romances in this anime, and they're actually good ones! Romance in general, has never been that one ship that holds that much water in shounen... or, in anything even slightly japanese in that matter... but when it comes to FMA:B, the romance-angle is actually pretty good... even enjoyable! And I'm not even talking about the \"sappy/sugary/over-the-top\"- romance either! I'm talking about the bonds between friends, loyalty between the master and the servants, and love between brothers, what's actually the main force of the story itself. The ever-so-subtle \"loyal-admiration\"- angle with Hawkeye and Mustang was truly memorable, same as the friendship between Musty and Huges, as well as the romance between Ed and Winry, that blooms and developes the same way as the characters grow and develope. Nothing is rushed or paisted on top to look more pretty to the eyes of the viewer. It's all very well done, in the sence that it's not so over the top -they never say that they love each other, but you can still feel and see that they do! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And what about the villains then? My all time favourite thriving force of any media or story-telling, that keeps me - if done right! - at the edge of my seat, begging for more and... well, let's leave it to that, shall we! The villains in this pick are also very enjoyable and well made, although the show itself do suffers that glorious \"too many characters at the same time!\"- syndrome, so that not so many chracters get their time of the day to really shine and develope as the rest of the main cast does, but the thing is, that not all of them truly even need to develope - Gluttony or Sloth, although nice in general, not really that interesting to look at. Those who do get their time in the spotlight - Kimbley, Scar, some of the Homunculi and Father, for example - do get their own backstory, motivations and their own little arcs to fulfill, some of them even growing and developing along the way. It's truly a treat to look at, and therefore I wouldn't have said a bad word if the show itself was actually... say, ten episodes longer than it was, but oh well... never please the fans - they're the worst!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kudos for the sublety though, since every single detail, action and mistake counts to something, developing both story and the characters, giving them even more motivation, and depth, through both stakes, and consequenses - when someone dies, they stay there... for good!\n",

The story, although actually relatively simple, is really so heavily and tightly packed with themes, philosophy, subplots and multi-colored characters with each of their own motivations and stories, that it's really easy to get lost in the middle of it all, and loose interest as a whole - good memory, and good attention span are needed! \n",

The musics are amazing, and the art isn't that bad either, so if you're interested to give it a go, go for it, and enjoy the ride!\n",

This anime, much like another anime called \"Monster\" (Check it out) are considered \"epics\" to me. They have a large cast, we see each character more than once, they go through a variety of different settings, have important themes and have great villians, in which sometimes you feel for the villians themselves (Envy).

      "The pacing of Brotherhood started off a bit iffy. In the first ten or so episodes, I felt it being a bit episodic. I mean, sure the first arc was about them uncovering the first batch of hard truths about what really was happening, but to me it felt just a little too episodic. Once it got around episode 11, I think that’s really when the show found its ground floor and it was uphill from there on.\n",

      "When everything was laid out for us and we were slowly fed what the over-reaching plot was, I couldn’t help but find myself so hooked to the screen episode after episode. Each one just pulled me in closer and closer, made me feel for these characters, made me want to know what was happening next, all the while not wanting to miss a single minute.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometimes anime can either bring better art styles to an adaptation than the manga ever did or it could be worse. In Brotherhood’s case, I think it fell somewhere in the middle of all of that.

From how it all flowed in animation to how all of the fights were so brilliantly created. \n",

      "I admit, I only watched the dub, so I can’t compare to how the English dub did as compared to the original subs, but I will say this: Funimation never fails to deliver on a great English dub. All around, the dub had a great cast. I don’t think no single voice actor or actress failed at what role they were given. A few standouts were: James Douglas(Major Miles), Vic Mignonga(Edward Elric), Kent Williams(Father), J. Michael Tatum(Scar), and Colleen Clickenbeard(Hawkeye).  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the sound effects and soundtrack, I think everything fit well. They timed the right moments with the right tracks.

I specifically loved the second OP and EP.\n",

      "Now to the characters. Such a large, yet wonderful cast of characters. Of course, thorugh it all, Ed and Al are the main focus through the first half. Then, that were we got to know the other characters at least in some bits. I really liked how each main character had their own arc and were given time to develop and grow in their own way. For example, I loved how Scar was able to grow in a way that made sense for him. I also liked how Greed kept on swaying from good to bad. I really felt for him.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One standout character through this all was Roy. I loved how his constant arc of the show was a combination of two things: Becoming fuehrer of the country and avenging Hughes. Throughout the entire ordeal of everything going around him, those two main objectives kept his character the most interesting, I think, especially the dark path he took for a few episodes. That really brought the realism of this show full circle and how one decision could set us down the wrong path.\n",

Fortunately the characters in this show are all memorable and interesting, in many different aspects. Something at this show does especially well is villains. Each of the main villains are all so different and intimidating in their own ways. While one villain's size is terrifying, as a contrast another one is just as, if not more, intimidating by simply being in a room with the main protagonists. The overall antagonist in this series is one of my favorites in all of anime. The intelligence, the power, the mystery, this is an all around great main villain. The heroes in this series are also very well written. The development of some takes over half the show to be even close to be complete, and it all pays off to create amazing co-stars. Taking a look at the main protagonists, the Elric Brothers, these are easily two of the best siblings in anime as well as other genres of television. There is a very strong and believable family relationship between them in many more ways than one. One character that outdoes the two brothers in terms of being well written is none other than their own father, Hohenhiem. Just saying one thing about his past would soil his character arc. Overall each character is original and believable in their own way, staying away from repetitious arcs such as \"someone died, now I'm evil\" with one exception, which is developed and improved dramatically. Everyone has a drive, some simple, some complex, but all of them well done.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art style is very beautiful, especially the locations such as Resembool and Fort Briggs. Color plays a key role in setting mood in this sometimes very dark and grotesque world. Lighting is very dynamic, showing very strong shadows for characters going through certain arcs and parts of life. The characters all have different looks and clothing making them easily distinguishable. There are however occasional quality drops but towards the end of the series these are very scarce. Music is also a very nice tone setting element with each song sounding like an orchestral piece. Some of these songs do get repeated quite a few times but if you're watching the show for your first time I can't see it being too noticeable or annoying. Many of the sound effects fit very well with situations and often give scenes that extra push, weather it be dramatic or silly. The official Funimation dub of this show is one of their best in my opinions. If you don't enjoy dubs, that's fine, but I suggest if you do try only one, try this one.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flaws of this series often resolve themselves over time. The true momentum of this show, where I found myself not wanting the episodes to end, was about episode 25. That's not to say anything before that isn't as good, that's just the point where I began to watch until I could barely hold my eyes open. I would love to give this show a perfect ten, but I will say it has it's flaws, few they may be. This is my favorite anime of all and I strongly suggest it to anyone who likes mystery, strong characters, and great fight scenes.\n",
      "let's talk about positive stuff first:\n",

      "There are just some series that when over you say “this was a great anime.” Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is that kind of series. There are times when remakes just don’t work (like the remake for the PSX game Wild Arms), but this is a remake that does pretty much everything right and as a total package is a great series. The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a good series that many enjoyed. Of course the ending and subsequent movie rubbed me the wrong way. But, I don’t think anyone can say it was a bad decision to go back and remake the series following the original\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "manga to the finish. The problem for the first Fullmetal Alchemist was that it started back in 2003. For those who didn’t know the manga finished alongside Brotherhood which ended in 2010. That is a lot of material that the original series could never cover. The only options available to Fullmetal Alchemist was doing an original story or stopping and waiting. Regardless of how that decision turned out that left a lot of material untouched and thus more than enough reason to do a remake. Of course if there is one thing I’m glad they remade the series for it was the EdxWinry relationship. The thing that didn’t really even happen in the original series with how it ended. This time it was done right and you are left smiling at the end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course the story wasn’t simply about these two brothers. At the core of it was Hohenheim, who was so critical to events. They condensed his history into an episode, but one can imagine the kind of life he had to lead. You could really feel sympathy for all the suffering he endured, but by the end he was proud of the life he lead.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It can just continue on with characters like Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar, Greed, Ling Yao, May Chang, etc. In terms of characters Brotherhood gets an A+ if I could since there were so many good ones that anyone who watches the series could have different top 5s. In terms of action a lot of characters outside the main leads got serious battles. Characters from Mustang to Ling had some great fights that are easy to remember even after the series has ended. In terms of serious battles it wasn’t like the leads did all the work at all. The best fights in the series probably would go to Mustang and Wrath. They received so many GAR moments it’s hard to believe. I liked how many of the characters really had their motivations tapped into so we could understand where they were coming from. Mustang had the desire to change the country and protect everyone while the powerful motivation to avenge Hughes also drove him on. Ling and May had the future of their respective clans on the line in the battle to curry favour with the Emperor of Xing and become Emperor or Empress. Everyone had things that were driving them forward and the main characters were just part of the whole thing. It’s not like you didn’t care about the leads since they were well developed, but you could care about other characters and no one would fault you.\n",
      "Now this is what I would call an Anime! Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has everything a viewer could ask for; action, adventure, suspense, thrill, humor, character, a splash of romance, and of course, fun. Not only that but this magnificent Anime includes scientific background; chemistry, to be specific. Could anyone actually believe that a Shonen Anime could have such depth? I couldn't, but Brotherhood kicked that belief's ass and put in a whole new genre of \"Shonen Anime\" in replacement.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The series is primarily dealing with the two adolescents: Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric. Starting off a bit slow, the series brings to you their past events\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "and also current events that leads to their status' as human beings. To be quite honest they have pretty much hit rock bottom, having committed taboo; loosing parts of their bodies, Alphonse's whole body; no parents...my lord, it's just to much to handle. The series shows these events in a unique, if I may say in a 'Spicy' manner. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though having a troublesome life, the Elric Brothers are near supreme in a technique called Alchemy (the reconstructing of chemicals into any specific shape or form). Most alchemists have to use a \"transmutation circle\" to use any form of reconstruction, yet the Edward can use alchemy with out the use of such. This brings him his name \"Fullmetal Alchemist.\" \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aside from the basics the plot is pretty much a rollercoaster, it changes all the time because of events that take place in the series. This is what I thought was so unique to Brotherhood compared to any other series. Interchanging plots are hard to come by, it puts enjoyment to a whole new level.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Referring to anymore of the story would just spoil what this series becomes. But what I can say is this alternating plot brings in the exquisite fun that the characters get to handle. New characters get brought in, characters change sides, even characters that have no damn idea what they are doing. This has a huge impact on the viewer, you will never know who to like. Honestly, it's a ton of fun.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now for the artsy side of the series. The music is definitely well composed, Akira Senju really out did himself this time. Every piece is used as fluently as possible, it'll be something new viewers should look forward too. The animation...okay, well this probably the only downer. Sorry to tell you, but the art just isn't the best. A little goofy looking at time, sometime the hair doesn't fully suit where the place of the head is, just a lot of stuff. But it isn't dreadful! It's honestly good for what it is and it is based on the way Hiromu Arakawa drew the manga. For the initial art not being at its finest, the actions and motions are eloquently done, no doubts there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as a conclusion this Anime is worth the time, with all it's elements and new frontiers, nothing can go wrong! If you are going to go on and watch the series, you are going to have a blast. And if you're not, that is your own opinion. But anyway, I hope all you viewers take this Anime in consideration, Thank you for reading!\n",
      "Overall this probably is the best anime ever created. Is it perfect? NO. Is it my favorite? NO. But it is overall very enjoyable for just about everybody. That is the strength of this show; it caters to just about everybody. There are some very funny moments and those are balanced out by some very dark and serious moments. There is plenty of intense action that is quite literally non-stop, and quite frankly it makes DBZ looking boring. The soundtrack for this show is probably my all time favorite for any anime, and I have some the songs on my I-Pod. The plot is very\n",

For 64 episodes long, I have never seen so many well flushed-out characters, but this anime achieves that no problem. The English Voice Dub is by far the best dub I have ever heard, and the voice for King Bradley is in a class of its own. I would recommend this to literally anybody, but especially those who like to see incredibly detailed and creative fight scenes. \n",

      "\r\n",
      "Overall: 9.5/10\r\n",
      "This show really should be viewed as a masterpiece due to the fact the story never goes off on any tangents that are unrelated to the plot. It sticks true to its guns and never lets up. The final scene involving the main villain achieving \"GOD\" is probably the coolest thing I have seen in anime, and it really makes the show more interesting overall. I would recommend this show to anybody. It's amazing, but not quite perfect.\n",
      "This is a very easy review. This show does not hold up on its own in anyway shape or form. It literally requires you to have read the manga or seen the previous anime. The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it. Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it. It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe. The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly to people who claim \"BEST EVER\" because\n",

There are almost no fillers and the plot will blow you away, at first I didn't want to watch this but I eventually gave it a chance, and after 2 episodes I was completely hooked and took every chance I could to watch it. It's one of the greatest anime I've ever seen!\n",
      "For a while I was very hesitant to watch FMA:Brotherhood. From what I had seen it seemed like a show that was based around humor and seemed like it wouldn't really go anywhere. Don't me get wrong, I love comedy, I just hate it when that's all the anime is about.That being said, brotherhood is hilarious at times, I often found myself laughing while watching it. I eventually decided to watch brotherhood, because I figured I should give it a shot. It has made it's way into my top 5 list and is one of the best animes out there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story- The story is explained fairly\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "well in the synopsis so there isn't much I can really say, but here is a small explanation of it from my point of view. So you have these two brothers who got into alchemy at a young age. They end up losing their mother and they try to bring back her back through alchemy (which is a taboo) but to no avail. In the process Edward Elric loses his leg and his brother Alphonse his entire body, in a worried attempt Edward sacrifices his right arm in order to bind his brothers soul into a suit of armor. The whole story is about their adventures to find a philosophers stone so they can use it's power and get their bodies back. With it being a long anime and having a fairly straight-forward goal in mind you would figure it would have some filler right? Absolutely wrong, there is not one episode of filler in brotherhood, that is what I like most about it. It's a long anime that has no filler! It has done what seems to be impossible to me. On-top of it having no filler, and having non-stop action every single episode, it actually isn't all comedy based like I had previously thought. It actually has a very dark side to it and it caught me off-guard within the first few episodes. A few scenes in particular have stuck with me and still make me depressed or have given me angst when I think about it. Not to sat that it doesn't have comedy in it, it's actually one of the funniest animes I have watched, but the comedy feels good in it and doesn't feel out of place like some anime I have watched.  It has a ton of plot twists that you don't actually see coming and gives you a ton of back-story so you actually feel like you know these characters, not  just the main characters either, you really get to know some of the side characters. They don't feel like they where just there, they all have depth and feel important to the story, and if something happens to them you actually get worried about them and care what happens. It had an extremely good ending and I had only 1 complaint about the whole story. I don't want to spoil anything, but lets just say the ending was \"missing something\". It was nothing critical to the main story, but if they had added a little more at the ending and emphasized on a few things it would have made it that much better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art- The animation and art are really well done. It had some rather creepy and eerie feeling artwork in it, which really set the mood. Nothing much to really say, it was top notch animation and artwork.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound-It has a various number of openings and endings, all of which I really liked and enjoyed. Brotherhood has one of the best English dubs in existence, they voice acting is extremely well done and I couldn't imagine watching it any other way.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character- Brotherhood has a really amazing cast of characters, a rather huge cast of characters that actually have a ton of depth to them and feel important. The two main characters Edward and Alphonse are just awesome people. Edward has a height complex, which he gets made fun of alot and I find it just hilarious. Then you have Alphonse who is just a badass and wants to just get back to his original body. Some of the side characters I really like are Winry, who is a child hood friend of Edward and Alphonse, Louis Armstrong, who is just a monster of a man who flaunts his muscles every chance he gets and gets beat up on by his sister(which is hilarious), ling, who is a foreigner who is actually quite badass, and last but not least is colonel mustang, who is arguably the strongest alchemist with his fire alchemy. My point being is that the entire cast is just awesome and very well made.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment- There was never a dull moment with this anime, whether it was one of the amazing fight scenes going on, something tragic happening, a crazy plot-twist, or just something hilarious, there was always something entertaining happening. You would have to be a really boring person not be able to get some sort of entertainment from this.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall- Overall this is really a masterpiece of an anime. I judge anime very harshly and it made it's way to my top 5 list, so if that doesn't something I don't know what does. It is a very enjoyable anime that ANY otaku should watch. I really can't properly explain how awesome this is, just go and watch it and you will understand, just make sure you watch the dub, because it is a really well done dub.\n",

      "I probably have more to say, but here's a brief summary, sorry if this pisses off any fanboys.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The good:\r\n",
      "It's beautifully animated, and the music is incredible. While I got tired of the little animation gags they did, the fights were so good it made up for it entirely. The score, like I said, was amazing, really loved it. Also there are some good characters and solid episodes. \n",
      "\n",
      "...\n",
      "The bad:\r\n",
      "First, it's kind of boring. I honestly just didn't really get engaged in the show until part 4, then it immediately got boring again. The only episodes I was really engaged in was the Ling, Wrath, and Hohenheim episodes, and those were few and far between. \r\n",
      "This brings me to my second issue, the characters. Personally, Ed and Al are some of my least favorite protagonists of all time. I'll try not to get into too many spoilers but they pretty quickly run out of motivation once the truth of the philosopher's stone was revealed, so then they story controls them rather than the other way around. This is really important especially in the ending, when it's revealed that the fight they think they're fighting has been going on for literal thousands of years and Hohenheim already has many contingencies in place. Other characters like Scar and Kimblee are also super cool, but totally wasted as they don't end up mattering AT ALL in the larger story.\r\n",
      "Finally, I don't understand the universe. They claim it's all about equivalent exchange, but it's never explained how characters can just make stuff, like Mustang can just make fire, or Scar can just destroy stuff. Even if you can explain that, why are there even different types of Alchemy, why does flame alchemy exist, and if it does, why can't Edward do it. Other than not needing a circle, is Edward actually special? I was just constantly confused by the power system and different types of alchemy, despite them all being the same. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, it's okay. I like some of the characters (Ling, Greed, Wrath), and again the animation alone maybe makes it worth watching. However, the story and the protagonists just didn't do it for me. I know it technically reaches into deeper themes of truth and loss and whatever, but like I said, it reaches. The story isn't good enough to actually be deep, it just feels like it's trying too hard and not actually making a story worth watching.\n",
      "I can not understand how the frick this show is number 1 on mal and has a score of 9.22 of the time of writing this because it sure as frick does not deserve that rating. The story is typical, a protagonist has a goal that is bound to be fulfilled by the end. People say the wordbuilding is brilliant but compared to most animes out now it isnt really that big of a deal. Storywise, it can go more into depth with its story and world but just doesn't. It isn't the worst though since it can be interesting sometimes. The art isn't because\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "of the source material but the anime production staff itself. I don't have a problem with it and i actually find the animation quite apealing. Some viewing positions can make a scene feel more tense and eerie which i really like about fmab. Sound is not really too much of a problem execpt for the fact that the op 1 is the only good op, other than that sound is pretty average. I really don't like a lot of the characters especially alphonse and may. Those 2 never cease to piss me off throughout the show. The sound of alphonse's voice makes me want to choke on a rusty nail and may is just just such a useless and annoying character and the panda god i just wanted it to die already. Other than that the characters weren't the worst and some like Roy actually surpassed my expectations. I didn't hate fmab but i also didn't like it. I was slightly intrigued while being bored at the same time. This anime was not memorable to me whatsoever and was very forgettable. That saying it was not the worst iv'e ever seen and there are defiently better like Hunter and Berserk. In conclusion i wish this show was not ranked 1 because it doesn't deserve to be while Hunter X Hunter does.\n",

      "in a world where the primary form of warfare is through alchemy, the science of deconstructing and reconstructing matter. The presiding law of alchemy, known as the 'Law of Equivalent Exchange', states that humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I won't provide a summary of the anime, as that's already provided. So let me instead say that the storyline of FMAB is--in a word--genius. There's no other way to describe it. There are so many intricate plot twists that just cannot be predicted. This anime starts as simply the Elric brothers' quest to restore their bodies. But it turns into SO much more. As the Elric brothers meet new people--and lose many of them--they realize there is a large underground conspiracy at work in Amestris. Suddenly they are pulled into something much greater than their mission, and they find themselves working to save not only their loved ones, but their country and the entire world. \n",

      "*KEEP IN MIND* This series is different from the 2003 anime known as \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". The first 10 or so episodes of FMA adhered to the original plot of the manga, and then the anime series diverged because the manga had not been completed. Personally, I hated the diverged plot. It simply did not seem logical. The ending of the series was terrible, and the follow-up movie, \"The Conqueror of Shamballa\", was also awful. I felt the 2003 anime and movie did not do full justice to the original Fullmetal Alchemist story. \n",

Arakawa-san (the mangaka of this series) puts great detail into the city of Amestris, the military uniforms of Central Command and Briggs, and every other tiny detail all the way to the last screw in Edward's automail arm and leg. And then there are the transmutation circles!! These were constructed so intricately, I have such unfathomable respect for Arakawa-san for all the work she put into designing these. The art is genius. It enhances the plot and characters even more--if that's even possible--and couldn't better suit the feel of this series. \n",

Tunes like \"Far East Suite\" depict relaxation; \"Overture ~Brotherhood~\" is beautifully reminiscent; \"Xing Symphony (Overture)\" is the perfect music for any battle scene; and don't even get me started on the intensity and tragedy of \"Lapis Philosophorum.\" I don't think even Beethoven could have done it better. I have the highest respect for Akira Senju, the FMAB OST composer. The music doesn't distract, but it certainly intensifies every single scene, forcing the viewers to make the characters' emotions their own.\n",

Edward is your typical strong-willed pig-headed protagonist with an unbelievably tragic past and an ironically huge complex about his height. Alphonse is the more mild-mannered brother, the voice of reason in the relationship between the two of them. Together, they are unstoppable. Their closeness is admirable. \n",

There are the heroes of Central Command, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, Heymans Breda, Maria Ross, Kain Fuery, and Black Hayate. And then there are more heroes from North Command at Briggs: General Olivier Mira Armstrong, Major Miles, Captain Buccaneer, and Vato Falman. Every single character in this anime with a name has a huge purpose. Not a single person is underrepresented.\n",

The homunculi--nearly invincible and humanlike--are named after the Seven Deadly Sins and emulate their respective sins. But the viewers always catch a glimpse of their humanity--the sadness behind the atrocities they commit, the longing behind their overconfident facades. Sometimes it's difficult to even call them villains, because Arakawa-san shows us that they're not much different from us. Can we really hate them? I have yet to figure that out myself. \n",

You never know what's going to happen--you can always expect the unexpected. And you can always count on Edward to diffuse a tense battle moment by tripping and falling or getting angry at someone for calling him short.

This series has made me cry and laugh and shout at my computer and ultimately smile contentedly at its ending. (While crying, of course, because I didn't want it to end!)

This series, however, is probably nine times better. Even seeing the original this is a completely new experience after about the first six or seven episodes. The artwork is great, not that the original was bad, but it just seems to have a slightly updated, high definition spin on the old. It also seems to add a bit more gore than the original, showing the inner workings of the fights rather than just blood squirts. I love this\n",

While FMA runs over character development, and you get to know almost every character as good as the main characters, Brotherhood fails in that. And they fail on that because Brotherhood is more story-orientated than FMA. The character development is so deep in FMA, that you feel like if an arc finishes when any secondary character dies, while in Brotherhood the death of a character just seems like an ordinary episode, the best example is Hughes, that while in FMA you get to know, and love him very much, in Brotherhood is just another death. This works just fine with Brotherhood, as you'll see when it develops ever further.\n",

      "Released in 2011, Brotherhood acts as a more direct and faithful adaptation to the original manga. This was most likely done to appease the fans of the manga who didn't care much for the divergent story in the original 2003 anime. Now, as much as I liked the 2003 anime, it had quite a few\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "flaws. After they went in a separate direction from the manga, the 2003 anime took a heavy nosedive. The plot became unfocused and it ultimately felt like a small story taking place in a massive setting. A lot of plot elements didn't click correctly, Wrath was fucking obnoxious, the ending was abrupt and rushed. It wasn't quite a masterpiece, but it was still really good. Then along comes 2011's Brotherhood and as you can probably tell, I think Brotherhood is significantly better than the 2003 anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood's story was focused, logical, had heart and emotion, was well executed, gave depth to every character that needed it and some that didn't, and even addressed some of the more annoying plot issues that the original anime had (and even some that were in the manga!) Every opening and closing song is great and fits the tone of the current arc, and personally my favorites were \"Again\" by Yui, and \"Let It Out\" by Miho Fukuhara. The soundtrack is unbelievable and carries a very emotional tone to the visuals, which are nothing short of great.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The great visual direction of the 2003 anime carries over to Brotherhood, with for the most part improvements in animation. The original's art style was a bit bland and dated poorly, but Brotherhood has a more timeless and comforting look to it that sets it apart. The only real problem I have it Envy. Envy's 3-dimensional animation for his true form is nothing short of unsightly. Putting 3D animation in a show like this is fine, so long as you don't do it once. That's because it will stick out horribly and look completely unnatural. Sure enough, it looks completely unnatural and ugly. Still though, nearly flawless. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As far as characters go, Brotherhood once again shines. Every character, even the \"evil\"* characters, are somewhat relate-able, understandable, and/or likable. I put an asterisk next to evil because Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of those clever little shows that knows that there is no such thing as good or evil. Every character's motivations and actions are clearly presented outside the childish realms of good and evil, so that every event feels real and the result of true human conflict. What would be a mustache twirler in any other show is a complex character with interesting traits and understandable motivations in Brotherhood.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I consider to be Brotherhood's greatest strength is its heart and emotion. I mean no hyperbole when I say I cried for the entire last 2 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Seeing every arc come together flawlessly and bring the anime to a close was absolutely beautiful, and it wasn't just the characters that held such powerful emotional weight. I was crying partially because I didn't want it to be over. It was too perfect and I couldn't believe it was over because I was enjoying it too much. I should say too that the list of things that have made me cry is a pretty short. It consists of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Pay It Forward, (some movie I can't remember at the minute), and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. So to say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood carries emotional weight is a massive understatement, as it is not only intelligent, but made with real heart and it shows.\n",

      "I don't give 10s out very often in any format, but Brotherhood most certainly has earned its mark. While the 2003 anime was very good and still outshines most other shonen, Brotherhood feels like the Fullmetal Alchemist series is just taking a victory lap. It's so good that it's practically unfair to even label it a shonen. It can appeal to anyone and everyone, and in my opinion, is virtually flawless.\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the most critically acclaimed anime loved by both connoisseurs and casuals.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let me start with the very first mentionable point to notice, which is a negative one. This anime expects its viewers to be already well acquainted with the franchise before watching it. So, the introduction is pretty straight forward and awkwardly so. I get that it has its alternative version or a manga with proper introduction. But, that's not Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and people would definitely not like to read the manga or another anime with 51 episodes before watching a 64 episodes anime just for a proper introduction.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "In Brotherhood, at the beginning, you see the characters doing whatever they do without you knowing what it is that they're doing, or even saying. \"Oh so he's the Fullmetal Alchemist!? Whatever the hell is a Fullmetal Alchemist anyway?\" So, yeah.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite being awkward at the beginning, there is something that still makes it perceivable. You don't know the details, but you have a vague idea that something is actually happening, so the viewers are tempted to watch further to know what exactly was it as there were many flashy things going on and it felt like there was some meaning to it. It's a cheap trick to hook the viewers, but it worked. That's what saves it from being dropped at the very beginning, but the fact that it's awkward still remains. This is how it is for the first few episodes. After that you get rewarded for not dropping it earlier with some genius story composition. This anime's storyline considers a number of possibilities and takes the best path. Which ends up with a brilliant ending, that I consider one of the bests among happy endings. It packs up the whole series nicely, making it a complete story.\r\n",
      "The anime has an overarching and well progressing plot handled carefully. I didn't notice any bothersome inconsistency after the opening episodes. The story isn't repetitive in any way. It's story is simple but has considerable depth to it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the characters who were introduced at first had improper introduction, I as a viewer got along with them as time passed. The characters introduced later on are well presented. But, the character development in this anime is very typical and genric. Bad guys get saved by the good guys, realize that they shouldn't follow the orders of the evil bosses and help the good guys on their own will. And someone gets violent as hell who doesn't feel strong restraint when killing someone almost overnight after a harsh experience. Something we haven't ever seen? The development on the good guys isn't remarkable and sometimes nonexistent. There are however some really good character development. For example, the slow and consistent development of that greedy man I forgot the name of who used to own a mine or something that he lost due to our MC, Edward Elric and some Homunculi. What's genuinely good about this anime's characters is the screentime distribution. This is very essential in this anime in particular, partly because it has many likable characters and it'd be really disappointing if they didn't get enough screentime.\r\n",
      "The antagonism in this anime is shallow, with very weak reasons and goals to justify for all the dreadful deeds. The evil military personnel and some other bad guys are horribly one dimensional. The character interaction is decent, but could've been better. The overall cast is very well handled, nevertheless.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I liked the world building in this anime. It makes big approaches by dividing the State, having different regions with different climate, culture, general attitudes and lifestyles. It makes medium approaches by having different cities, towns, countrysides, etc with their definite geological location and connecting them with consideration of distance and cultural transition. And finally, it makes small approaches by detailing the small points in the places where the story takes place in. It's attention to tiny details like mud on the body after crossing a muddy path, or dirts after falling on the ground were mesmerizing but never preachy. The anime makes no unrealistic or unbelievable change in the already established environmental points. Basically, it did excellent job on the places it shows. But unfortunately, it doesn't show majority of its world. We only get to properly see The State of Amestris. It gives a small idea of Xing through some of its characters from that empire, but that wasn't enough to relay a good description. We don't really even know if there's any other country aside from the State of Amestris, Xerxes and the Empire of Xing. And even if it did mention other countries, it must've been very unimpressive for me to remember or even notice. In short, it doesn't quench one's thirst for the view of its world. Then again, it's a good thing that the anime doesn't go out of its way to show around the parts of the world that aren't important, consequently not drawing the attention away from the story. I'd like to inform you that it has a town based on automails as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Automails are prosthetic limbs made of metal. The technology behind this element is not much explained, but I really liked it. How they presented that there is nerve connection and the pain of that time really made me feel it. I liked how there are so many types of automails. And loved the idea of having different types of automails for different weather. Basically I loved how they didn't leave it as it is just because it's not a main element and was used for more reasons than just showing Edward's resolves.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main element, Alchemy, is an edited form of the Alchemy we know. Here, one can understand, break and reconstruct matters and that's what Alchemy here is. It's not very deep, but efficient. Aside from shooting pillars and rocks (like wtf!?), the use of Alchemy is very good. The difference in the usage of Alchemy between the West and the East is interesting. Alchemy is adequately crafted to satisfy a superficial view while also running the story, it's not enough explored to get past the highly functioning brains that like to go deep into analysis. But well, it doesn't need to be extremely deep and didn't do anything pretentious to make it deep either. The shooting pillars and rocks are still blatant though.\n",

      "The power curve of this anime is very good. The MC isn't utterly overpowered. In fact, he's far outranked by many people. He trains, but doesn't become stronger than most of them which is really plausible. The overpowered villain is justified. I loved how in the end, the anime didn't pull any unnecessary, unbelievable, unreliable power up to defeat the overpowered villain.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A bothersome point in this anime is the immortal army. FMAB does have a realism that it sticks to, but this particular point is slightly too unrealistically overdone considering its realism. It's not really much necessary either. I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have felt anything lacking if this wasn't here. The evil military personnel could've been brainwashed instead of tempted, which could've solved an aforementioned issue as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyway, many of the shortcomings in this anime are obtained through nitpicking and are massively outweighted by its greatness. The plot points are tied very well so there's no considerable loose end. It's overarching with its elements and plot but still very well handled. There are sufficient job done on everything. It's philosophy is simple and unpretentious. The main philosophy that for getting something, there has to be a sacrifice of equal amount is an excellent example. It also tells us to not be too conceited. There are many other teachings relayed in the anime. Truth's vague existence actually plays well here.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMAB has great animation and cinematography. The artwork of the character design is good, but how it was used was slightly problematic. Especially when you can't tell that a seemingly man is actually a woman. The reason might be that almost all the faces are designed rounded and there are little difference in male and female facial construction. Well, I'm not sure if it's because of getting used to it or the improvement of the art, but it seems perfect later on. It's probably the latter but if just in case it is the former, then the anime does great job helping the viewers to get used to it. The attire design is excellent and the colors are masterfully used while designing the characters. It has some extremely well choreographed fight scenes which are exhilarating. This anime has by far one of the best collection of opening and ending songs if not the best. All of them are great. Some are easily top list materials. The background musics are remarkable as well. Loved Lapis Philosophorum in particular.\r\n",
      "The atmosphere of this anime is not as dark as its former 2003 version and I found it more fitting. The lighthearted un-overwhelming atmosphere is a better choice here, imo.\r\n",
      "This anime is superficially perfect. It's specialty is that it has almost everything you need to learn and can ask for from an anime. And there's no way to call it \"pretentious\". Overall, it's very well put together and definitely one of the best anime I've watched so far.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a tier 1 9/10 show.\n",
      "I thought it was terrible! It’s the worst show that I have ever seen… is what I would like to say. To my surprise, FMA:B is the best shounen show that I have seen in my life (not that I have watched many other shounen series, but whatever). If I had seen this as a kid, I may have been reeled to watching anime way earlier than I did. Note that I haven’t watched the first anime adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist and I don’t think I will anytime soon.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Frankly, I was hesitant to pick up FMA since I tend to avoid shounen like the plague,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "but since I have dedicated myself to watching the more popular shows recently, I figured that this is the one that I should start with (also with a lot of persuasion power on the part of my friends).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What made me like this show? Well, for starters, It is very, very entertaining. Believe it or not, I finished watching the whole of FMA:B in just four days. I loved it that much. It had very nice fight scenes and overall aesthetic appeal. But FMA:B had something that similar shounen shows didn’t have: direction. Unlike most other shounen anime, FMA:B knows that it has a story to tell. It doesn’t waste time on things that do not contribute something to world building, character building/development or historical background. You will even find yourself amazed that “filler” episodes aren’t exactly filler.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I guess this is from the fact that the manga has already ended when Brotherhood was made, but it’s still pleasant to find a shounen anime that doesn’t troll you (hello there Bleach, Naruto and One Piece!) or make kids’ games a part of a large scale of glorified nonsense (hello there every single toy advertisement anime!).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other than these things, FMA:B still keeps the spirit of shounen, an anime that appeals to young children, while being entertaining enough to be appreciated by the veteran anime watcher. I guess the only thing that I would nitpick about is its virtually zero rewatch value. I wouldn’t really want to watch this all over again, but hey, that’s a prime characteristic of a shounen show and I’m completely fine with that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I’d love to tell you more about this anime, but I wouldn’t want to spoil all of the juicy parts. I say, just watch it and see for yourselves – a shounen with direction, protagonists with personality and hard-earned real power, and a very nice show to look at. I couldn’t ask any more from an anime from a genre that I don’t usually watch.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As of this writing, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of my all-time favorite shows at number 5 with my personal MAL rating of 8.\n",
      "Having watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series at a young age (the series itself came out in 2004, I believe), my twelve-year-old self was stoked when I found out that there was a reboot whilst screwing around on some anime chat room. The year was 2010. Needless to say, I ended up loving the show, even more than the original. All of my favorite characters had returned, and were just as badass as ever. But this anime needs more than a paragraph. It deserves more than that. There's a reason that people still discuss it, and the fanbase is just\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "as fervent as when the show was airing all the way across the Pacific in good old Nihon. Or the Atlantic and all of Asia... Whatever. Same thing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story:  Without getting too deep into the FMA:B storyline, the basic premise of the show involves two brothers who, accidentally (duh), forfeit their limbs and bodies in an attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy, which also happens to be a moral taboo. They then seek to find some way of restoring their lost humanity (and pride) by setting out on a journey in search of the fabled Philosopher's Stone. The story, of course, does not end there. But what fun would it be if I spoiled anything else? Alchemist's story manages to be engaging with, quite amazingly, zero baggage, even while clocking in at beefy 64 episodes. There is a clear purpose constant throughout each episode that never gets muddled or buried by another storyline. Everyone has their motives, and these motives propel the story forward. Some people might find the first few episodes somewhat rushed, as they cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. I assume that this is because much of said material was covered in the first series, which most viewers have typically seen. The pacing eventually evens out, however, when new material is introduced. The anime's story follows the original storyline of the manga, which the original veered away from about halfway through its runtime. And, in my opinion, the manga storyline is much better. There are too many differences to cover, and doing so would mean spoilers, but I will say that the ending in Brotherhood is perfect, much better than the original's mediocre one.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art and Animation:  The show is animated by Studio BONES (Soul Eater, Space Dandy, Eureka Seven, Wolf's Rain, Darker than Black, Gosick, Ouran). Those familiar with BONES know that it, when given a good budget, can rival any other studio in production quality. As with Brotherhood, the animation is wonderful. The art is very colorful, and the characters' features stand out amongst the backdrops. The show's visual quality is superior to the original, which is expected with a higher budget. As great as the art is, it isn't jaw-dropping.                                  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound: There's not much to talk about here. The soundtrack is perhaps a bit above average, and while it fits and benefits the show, it isn't something I would rush to purchase. The sound design (sound effects, etc.) is worth mentioning, as it brings the fast-paced alchemy battles and gunfire-laden battlefronts to life. Vic Mignogna's performance as Edward Elric in the English dub is also noteworthy.                                \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters:  This is the beef of the show (as with almost all good animes, imo). Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric reprise their roles as the main protagonists in Brotherhood, as well as all supporting protagonists. The villain cast, mainly comprised of mysterious apparitions named after the 7 Deadly Sins (if that doesn't make you want to watch the show, I don't know what will) returns for a second round at our heroes as well. As simple as it sounds, it's not quite so. For starters, there is a substantial amount of characters. It's not the most I've ever seen, and not all that tricky to keep track of (animes like Baccano!, for example), but viewers familiar with harem shows or other tightly-knit casts might be uncomfortable at first with the scale of Alchemist's world. But it's this scale and complexity that moves the show's pistons, all while elevating it above its competition. Not a single character is unnecessary, each one playing some form of role that completes the show. The chemistry between Ed and Al is vital not only for the show's plot, but for the emotional links necessary to keep a viewer interested in a 64 episode show. On the antagonist side, our villains possess just as much chemistry. Er, well, at least some of them... There are some characters whose presence also defies the typical good-vs-bad, and are not necessarily anti-heroes either. Their existence alone provides plenty of material, which, of course, relates back to the main plotline. None of the characters are annoying, which is perhaps the most amazing feat (most shows have at least one character that is obnoxious). Kudos to the writers on these characters. They could be the best I've ever seen.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Final Verdict:  Fullmetal Alchemist has been a huge staple in the anime world since 2004. After Brotherhood, it has become a legend. I always find it easier in hindsight to criticize shows and nitpick their flaws. As I grow older, I'm able to look back at shows that I loved as a kid and accept that they were not the pinnacle of entertainment (Dragonball series, Pokemon, etc.). Looking back at Brotherhood, however, only affirms what I thought of it as a preteen: one of the greatest series of any form of entertainment that I have ever viewed. The world of anime, as well as films, music, video games, and even politics is full of fads, things the “come and go”, as we commonly put it. Five years from now , Sword Art Online will be an obscure title that very few will remember or know about. It's been a decade since the original FMA aired in Japan, and many still discuss it. I anticipate that in the years to come, many will discuss Brotherhood, whether it's children mesmerized by the animation and color, teenagers in awe of the epic actions scenes, young adults enamored in the subtle romantic subplots, or adults impressed and intrigued with the complex chemistry between the characters.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "One problem in both long and short anime alike is often the ending. Since a lot of anime are based on manga or light novels, they are sometimes released before the source material is finished. Therefore, the anime may have that fancy \"Completed\" status, but it's actually just waiting for season 2. Which may never happen anyway, if the initial release isn't popular enough. Of course, there are also endings that are just plain bad, either leaving too much hanging or just not being well-written.\n",

That's not a bad thing; on the contrary, that means it was really well-written. But I personally prefer happy endings.\n",

      "As someone who is fairly new to anime, I wasn’t really sure on what show I should watch, and with over 12,000 anime titles, it was hard to pick something to follow through on. Then came Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I was recommended this series in March 2015 by a friend, but it didn’t get around to it until May 2016, and I’ll be honest, I’m starting to kick myself for not getting onto this series earlier.\n",

Two brothers, Ed and Al Elric on a mission to get their mum back through the use of alchemic powers, but then sh*t happens; one loses their body, the other an arm and a leg. They end up uncovering all sorts of mysteries going down in their country, Amestris. That’s all I can say on the matter without spoiling it, but expect a lot of action, bloodshed and conspiracy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I gotta hand it to Hiromu Arakawa for this story and the way the anime writing team adapted it in the series; It flowed almost seamlessly as if the viewers were being exposed to real-time events taking place in the world, and among all of the action and countless loss of lives, it felt pretty realistic. That’s right, not keeping characters on to do justice to fans, the unexpected turn of events in the story, and a very clear and believable issue of life and humans being portrayed. There were also some light-hearted elements to ensure you weren’t too depressed from watching this, and I thought witty banter, unexpected jokes and sarcasm added to the overall value of the show. I lost count of the amount of times the episodes in this series left me thinking “holy sh*t”, “Why him/her” or “god, that was amazing”, or even make me laugh a bit. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a writer, I was impressed to see the vast amount out characters in this show, but also on top of that, each character was given just the right amount of exposure for you to cling on to them. I hate to compare, but thinking about some of the mediocre cartoons I watched when I was a kid, many secondary characters in some series don’t get a lot of possible on-screen time, and writers could have used them to an advantage to the overall story they were telling, and the writing team for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood did just that; for that, well done.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In terms of animation, Bones anime studio did a fantastic job on the this, from the realistic set designs and well-drawn characters, to the epic alchemic action scenes and transformation sequences. I’m familiar with the anime studio’s recent works, Akagami no Shirayukihime (Snow White with the Red Hair), which they did a good job on the setting, but I would admit it was not as great as the effort they put into increasing the believe factor of the viewers for this series’ animation.\n",

      "Akira Senju did incredibly well with the soundtrack for this series and deserves every bit of praise for it. The music made every bit of this anime more immersive, and even though you may hear some of the songs again (as expected for anime), no matter how classical it is, I bet you will end up singing along with it. I’m not a fan of classical music, but for this soundtrack, I surely enjoyed every piece.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sub or Dub? I watched the FUNimation dub to this series. I’m not a sub watcher, and I’ve heard a lot from a few anime fans discouraging dubs in general. However, watching the dubbed version of this, who can argue the fact that the voice acting is just golden? Vic Mignogna and Maxey Whitehead did an absolutely stellar job on portraying Ed and Al Elric, along with many of the well-known names in the dubbing business: Ed Baylock, Colleen Clinkenbeard, J Michael Tatum, Todd Haberkorn, Travis Willingham and Chris Sabat, to name just a few, absolutely smashed it. So many of the greatest voice actors were put on the characters to bring each character to life the proper way, and I’ve got to thank FUNimation for their efforts.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I have praised this series, it does come with its slight downsides. Earlier I did mention there was some light-heated jokes that were injected into the series, but I personally felt the timing of the jokes in some episodes took away from the overall seriousness of the story at hand, which really did affect my standpoint on whether the matter of Ed and Al fighting to get their limbs and bodies back was a serious one, or one where it was preferable, but not important.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing I can’t help but criticise was the way some character emotions were portrayed in the show. In my opinion, I do think that some character emotions, such as anger, shyness and agitation, were over-exaggerated unnecessarily in the animation. I do get that this might have been done to conform with the style of anime and may have been an added value to the light-heatedness of the series, but this was something I wasn’t too jolly about, and maybe could have been toned down a little to make sure the story isn’t taken for granted.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To conclude, I’ll say this: as any other fan guy would say, “there should be more”, which may be want I want from an anime of this calibre, deep down I truly believe this anime is one of those series that is best left as it is: nothing more, nothing less. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is, without a doubt, a well-told, captivating and brilliant anime series, that every action-craver, whether you’re into anime or not, should at least make the effort to watch.\n",

      "First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "watching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community.  Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that it isn't a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn't be nearly as harsh\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "on it if it weren't for the God status the show has attained in America. I would happily remand \"greatest show ever made\" to \"greatest long-running shonen ever made if you haven't seen the 2011 Hunter X Hunter\"\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'm not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I'm going to use it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "STORY: 8\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren't looking at them. It's an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that's one of the marks of strong storytelling.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I've seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they're from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don't-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it's happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I'm not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there's a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn't how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show's ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it's resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "ART: 8\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don't have any real complaints there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes \"anime\" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I'll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There's a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience \"this is the funny part!\"\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that's really what matters. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOUND: 10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Undeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It's been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved 'Golden Time Lover' and 'Chemistry', but I have to give special mention to SID's 'Rain'. As far as I'm concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn't quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I believe that there is an intense connection between a show's opening and the audience's willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online's \"Courage\" and Guilty Crown's \"My Dearest\". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I digress.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CHARACTER: 6\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would definitely call out the show's characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that's not the main issue. It's because most of them are not really characters: they're plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They're entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he'll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they'll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It's not that it's melodrama: it's the fact that it's the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn't until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And that's the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character's only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are \"hates being called short\" and \"hates milk\" they're really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he's even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides \"we must overthrow the government\" and \"Hughes!\" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn't have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that's really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They're far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show's 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they're close to?? What are their personal histories...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh wait, sorry! I didn't mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yeah so I forgot to mention something. Screw all that stuff about making these characters possess complex personalities, FMA:B has a better way to define them.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "TRAUMA\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everyone who's remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It's a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here's the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn't Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of \"my wife left me because we were too poor\" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al's dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry's parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It's basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There's no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he's relatively safe.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They're difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don't make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn't anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a 'good guy' (*cough* Mustang)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don't-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their \"good-guy\" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn't even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an \"Adventures of the Homunculus\" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ENJOYMENT: 7\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher's stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show's apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I've already said it, but I don't know if I've driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don't-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That's not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That's something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It's character's speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I've already mentioned, they're repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "OVERALL: 7\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It's a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it's definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don't go in with irrational expectations. It's enjoyable, it's engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn't heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it's not by any means a bad show! I don't give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!\n",
      "Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Admittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then there's the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public's opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we'll get to that in a bit.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically \"shounen\" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively \"de-humanised\" by pushing them on to the non human characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn't steal a march on Arakawa. It's possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn't really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Interestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Strangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong's older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn't develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the \"de-humanisation\" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military's generals are concerned.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it's a testament to the quality of not only the actor's abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there's a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don't really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed's character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they're broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it's a testament to Arakawa's skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.\n",
      "Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here's why FMA:B and it's Manga counterpart don't work:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that's objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So why is it disjointed?\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Because there's a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don't mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they're implemented in the story. For example, one second we're dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn't fit. It's formulaic. It's predictable storytelling at it's finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I've ever seen); e.g. Edward's speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I'd hate to say in any other series because pretentiously \"dark and gritty\" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Personally, it just doesn't work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.\n",

The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This anime starts off at a breakneck pace.  It shoots entire volumes of the manga in a couple\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "of episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you'll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this \"generic shonen\" label.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al's father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn't feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character's values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn't expect any less.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there's no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.  Overall score: 9.4/10 (rounded to 9).\n",

I didn't give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That's a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character's have there own unique features that stand out among the rest.

I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don't blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al's actor. Al's original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That's how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you've all been waiting for, the characters.\n",

If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don't want to mess with. He'll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he'll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can't have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won't forgive you. He doesn't forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.\n",

It's kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn't hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There's even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won't spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!\n",

But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job. \r\n",

And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next. \r\n",
      "The voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.\r\n",
      "The sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.\n",

      "I found myself falling in love with these amazing characters while I was watching FMAB. It didn't matter if the characters were only shown for one episode, I'm looking at you Nina and Alexander. What mattered was the impact those characters gave. (Like a sledge hammer to the heart)\n",
      "\r\n",

      "This is one of those anime that will leave you feeling empty after you finish it. And I mean that in a good way. I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.\n",
      "I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series.

He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Events thereafter eventually culminate in a new mission for the Elrics; to procure the Philosopher's Stone and use it to recreate their own bodies.\n",

      "Sounds like heavy stuff, right?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Storyline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here. A definite 10/10.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Enter FMA: Brotherhood. Now this is a spectacular adaptation worthy of the manga; this is the epitome of a masterpiece anime. The series is just the right length; the storyline never drags, or falters. Although FMA:BH is strung together with an incredible strong plot, the characters are the real highlights of the series; the majority of the cast is thoroughly fully fleshed out with dilemmas worthy of our attention.

However, even this flaw is something that anyone can look past, since the show itself is so enjoyable. \n",

All the characters have so much depth that it's impossible to hate a single character of this anime.

      "I can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don't think there's much else to say here, top notch as always.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters - 10/10\r\n",
      "The second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.\r\n",
      "Even the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I've seen so far, that's a +1 right there.\n",

      "Enjoyment - In case it's not obvious by now, 10/10\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Overall - 10/10\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it's other version's \"awesomness\" and show us what anime truly is about, and that's how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won't be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won't. :)\n",
      "There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.\n",

      "actors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.\n",

      "So go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.\n",
      "This anime is going in the All Time Favourites List along with the other classics, you know like one piece, naruto, bleach, dbz and all that stuff.\r\n",
      "I'm not comparing with them though. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is not exactly like them. It is not the usual 'go on an adventure' type with dozens of episodes and fight scenes that all look the same. FMAB is more story-oriented and tactical.\n",

      "right blend of fantasy and reality.\n",

      "Not to mention, FMAB is one hilarious anime!! Then a little bit of drama and a little bit of a romance here and there gives it a proper outfit. I could recommend any type of person to watch this anime. For me it has become one of the classics\r\n",
      "I saw this show when I was small and liked it instantly. Because I didn't see it properly I saw it again, and boy, was I glad I did! I loved every bit of it. Now I wouldn't say it doesn't have flaws, but why be a nit-picker when it is so enjoyable. No anime is perfect to everyone's mark afterall, eh\n",
      "Story: Well this story is nothing short of amazing. It is so entertaining, and just interesting to watch. The comedy, and action are outstanding. It all blends in perfectly.

Heart filled moments just hit you like a damn bus. 10\n",

      "Character: Oh my god again perfection. The characters are all great. You basically grow up with Ed, and Al.

      "Enjoyment and overall: My enjoyment is through the roof. FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I think is going to stand the fates of time well. I was never bored like I am with some anime. I was always hooked. My enjoyment and overall score are both 10.\n",

      "It may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that's not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch Fullmetal\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Alchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you'll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters' profile.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters \"got that attitude from\". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I'd prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn't quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I'm just kidding! You probably won't regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can't tell you that for sure - you'll have to see for yourself.\n",
      "I was dreading having to make my way through Brotherhood at some point considering my high regard for the first series and not really liking the manga adaptation's more conventional plot developments. But considering enough people were praising the daylights out of Brotherhood and some even boasting that the first series was no longer relevant, I decided to check things out for myself and see what got people giddy over this adaptation of the series. And after venturing my way through Brotherhood, I would have to say that those calling the first series irrelevant are ridiculous considering both titles have completely different takes on their\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "source material and the handling of them that whichever series you prefer would depend on what you are looking for in an anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Brotherhood's case, it takes the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and makes a more closer adaptation of the source material which is quite focused on world building and creating a grand scale plot coming out of the Elrics finding out details about the Philosopher's Stone and eventually finding out about a national conspiracy and heinous plot connected to the Homunculus and powerful figures in the Amestris military. This take on FMA does follow a more conventional plot than the first TV series as much of the complex characterization found with prominent characters in the original series is greatly toned down with Brotherhood creating a more plot-focused series and morality with many characters being more black and white as the series has more purely \"good\" and \"bad\" characters with the former being always right in their convictions within the series and the latter having no redeemable traits and being wrong in their actions. With me believing that good characters in an anime should be morally grey with flawed heroes and villains with redeemable traits, I wasn't digging Brotherhood's conventional take on characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood did have some elements that I did get some enjoyment out of. With Brotherhood being more focused on world building and plot advancement, the series expands more on the world of the series than what the first series did by introducing more branches of the military and some other countries neighboring Amestris, particularly Xerxes and Xing. This also allows the introduction of some new characters in the series with several characters from Xing and within the military that Ed and Al befriend and ally with when dealing with the Homunculus and the conspiracy they uncover. In addition, some characters from the original series who were underdeveloped and not having much screen time (Hohenheim, Alex Armstrong and Roy Mustang's men being prominent examples) are given more focus in this series, get some moments of fleshing out and are given bigger roles to play.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still though, there are enough issues I have with Brotherhood that outweigh the praises I give it above. The show's first 12-13 episodes run at a fast pace providing little time to connect with characters introduced and with the events of those episodes having been portrayed in the first series, Bones appeared to have intentionally sped through the events to get going with what wasn't covered by the first series. With Bones more closely following the manga's storyline for Brotherhood, these earlier episodes had featured a major flaw to FMA manga-ka Hiromu Arakawa's earlier chapters in that her fast advancement of events gave little time for emotional investment from readers in regards to how characters reacted to major events that shook their resolves as the lack of time and depth on plotting in earlier chapters did kill their quality to a great extent. With the slower pacing and greater character focus found in FMA's first series, Arakawa had adopted these elements to a degree with her storytelling in later chapters which helped improve the quality of her writing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also found myself getting quite irritated with the show's comedy getting in the way of more serious moments. This was quite prominent in Brotherhood's earlier episodes where moments of slapstick and characters going super-deformed killed the suspense of serious moments. While the series does tone down on these moments in later episodes as the plot gets darker and more serious, they still pop up on occasion and when they do, I still found them to be a mood killer during most scenes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite the praises I gave for new characters and expanded depth on underdeveloped characters who appeared in the original series, I couldn't give the same thing for a majority of other characters who appeared in the first series. Brotherhood's portrayal of these characters are more conventional and less complex as heroic characters aren't confronted with any possible flaws to their actions and personal beliefs; as well as all the villains being so shallowly evil that they're laughable and I could care less if they get beaten up and killed off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The final episodes to a good extent also felt quite contrived with how things progress just to allow all the surviving characters to have a good ending. A number of moments were deus ex machina thrown in for villains to be defeated through means which the series never explored and they kind of cheapen how I felt about the hardships faced by the Elrics and other prominent characters to get what they desire.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In terms of presentation, visual details with Brotherhood are a bit simpler than the first series with color tones being more subdued. This is especially prominent with background designs in many shots as their quality looks quite washed out compared to scenery found in the foreground. Still, character designs of those from the original series still look the same as they were from over five years ago. While animation shortcuts are apparent in a good number of shots in Brotherhood, the series does have its animation highlights with the occasional fluid fight sequence and some good fight scenes involving Envy's true form.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For music, much of Brotherhood's insert music consists of stringed and piano pieces that do well at complementing the peaceful and intense moments seen throughout the series. On the other hand, many of the OP and ED musical choices chosen for the series consisted of some generic J-Pop and J-Rock that hardly grabbed my interest, though the first OP, Yui's again, did well at fitting with Brotherhood's mood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I found my perceptions of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be no different from when I read the manga. It goes for a more conventional style of storytelling compared to the first FMA series and while it does have its moments of good quality involving character focus and world building, its more plot heavy and conventional focus drives it to lose much of the complexity given to prominent characters of the first series and the poor quality to its plotting in its beginning and ending episodes does kill quite a bit of the plot buildup that I would be expected to care about. While a worthwhile watch to those craving an epic-style action-adventure series or wanting a more faithful adaptation of the FMA manga, those wanting better characterization and solid drama with the series (in my case) would be better off seeing the 2003 anime adaptation of FMA.\n",
      "Full metal alchemist brotherhood the anime that has been called a masterpiece for so many years well to day I'm here to tell you my thoughts on that.Many people feel this way because it strictly follows the manga but just because an anime follows the manga doesn't necessarily mean its good.\n",

      "Story- Now I will spoil some of the story in this review. FMAB started off pretty good then I realized a lot of stuff was not being explained the pacing was getting more and more shitty. Now many people say FMAB has a amazing story and its a masterpiece well It might've started off like that but it slowly evolved into a save the world from the big bad villain with a god complex kind of story. Now some parts in the story were very suspenseful and had my full attention. Then some parts of the story were really boring and I found myself zoning out continuously. The story had some really grasping scenes like when Hughes was murdered and when the guy with the blonde hair who loves to smoke(forgot his name lol) was stabbed in the back and was paralyzed for the waist down for the rest of his life and when Roy mustang flipped his shit and roasted Envy alive, those scenes were timed really well and caught me off guard. One thing FMAB did was focus on the drama to much which resulted in a shit ton of over dramatic scenes. Some of the dialogue was cliche and I couldn't stop fucking laughing because they were trying to be serious but I just couldn't take it serious, and I even started predicting some of the events in the story would happen. Anyway the story starts to go down hill and now the elric brothers new objective is to stop the bad guy who wants to obtain the power of god with them finding their bodies being their side quest. Then they have this cliche shounen ending where a seventeen year old kid beats the shit out of god. I mean this is just beyond cliche, the fight was good but i wasn't suprised because in the end i knew he would win. And the fairy tale happily ever after ending was disappointing to.   They never explained the origins of alchemy clearly nor do they explain anything else clearly so I was left with a shit ton of questions but no fucking answers. The story just didn't pull me in and It felt like I was just watching your typical action anime the story wasn't shit it just wasn't a masterpiece like everyone said it was.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Animation / Sound : The Animation was pretty good the character models and the back grounds were well done and so was the animation and art for the alchemy. The fight scenes where pretty neat but nothing too flashy. The voice acting was A1 I thought the sound effects for the fights and explosions were done well to. The intros and ending were just mind blowing sometimes I would just go on YouTube and just watch and listen to the intros. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters: This is the weakest part of the anime.\r\n",
      "Our 2 MCs Edward and Al do not change through out the whole series they remain the same naive little boys they were at the beginning hell the only thing that changed about Edward was his height he became taller as the series continued. Most the characters in FMAB get no development at all and some are just useless as fuck cough...cough... winry, now I don't dislike winry but sometimes she just annoyed the hell out of me and got in the way. The only characters in this show who got good development was Roy Mustang, Envy, crippled cigarette guy(forgot his name), hoenhime (I think I spelled it wrong), and Ling/Greed. Half of the villains on here are evil just for the hell of it and oh yeah the main villain with the god complex is called father he basically created the rest of the villains. Each of them are named after the 7 deadly sins and called homunculus. Apparently each villain represents a fragment of his soul you have\r\n",
      "The homonculus were extremely shallow and were evil to be evil. I mean out of all seven only three shine and those three are Wrath, Greed, Envy. The rest are extremely uninteresting including father. If i had to compare him to a villain it would be Aizen from bleach. \r\n",
      "Now out of all of these villains the most memorable was Envy because of his hatred of humans and his twisted personality he was very exciting to watch and his death was put together really well. Now back to the other characters  Scar was very interesting at first but as the series continued he started to bore the hell out of me until I finally wasn't interested in him any more. Like I said before Roy Mustang got a lot of development he went from the cool and calm guy we know and love to a bloodthirsty animal obsessed over finding out who killed Hughes. Now full metal alchemist brotherhood has some interesting characters but failed to give them any development to the point where I didn't give a fuck if they died.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end by no means was FMAB a bad show no it was a good show that had a lot of potential but it failed to amaze me the unique story was ruined after a couple of episodes. I personally think this anime is overrated as fuck it wasn't bad its just overrated and it just didn't prove to be a masterpiece like everyone claimed it was  , but in the end this is just my opinion . The funny thing is I watched this before  the FMA 2003 version because everyone kept telling FMA 2003 was trash and the funny thing is I ended up liking 2003 more.   Do i recommend this show No you might find your experience different than mine after all we are two completely different people but i don't recommend it bruh. Well I'm done i hoped you enjoyed this review Peace!!!\n",
      "To this day my writing is influenced by Fullmetal Alchemist. I read the manga about ten years ago, but I still remember most of the characters by name.

The themes of loss, sacrifice and transformation are seamlessly integrated into the plot and character backstories.\n",

      "There's a good reason why Fullmetal Alchemist has few peers. A story like this is impossible to create unless you've survived fucked up shit, possess the social support and intelligence to make sense of it and have the skills as a storyteller to convey those experiences. The author clearly thinks ill of shortcuts to personal growth (miracle cures, religion, etc.), evidenced by the first episode alone.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seems obvious to point out the inspiration to this series is human darkness - even ethnic genocide makes it into the plot. It's astonishing how deep Fullmetal Alchemist goes with its harrowing concepts, yet rarely feels depressing. The characters talk about their emotions, then keep pushing forward, make new allies and grow as people. To be fair though, they don't actually get many chances to lament their misery, because the intense plot constantly whips them forward.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main mysteries involving the plot are discovered shortly into the series, but the bad guys quickly clean house and cover everything up. This killing creates an incredible tension that sets the pace for the entire rest of the series. Not only that, but on many occasions the episode's cliffhanger is just brutal, reminiscent of Attack on Titan. Friendly advice: DON'T watch this series before bed, make the time to binge it!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cast of characters is varied in genders, ages and body types. Their designs are focused and simplistic, though not without depth. Unlike how females are often drawn in anime, in Fullmetal Alchemist they look nice, but not overtly sexualized. There's also just about no fanservice. Even some of the evil characters are surprisingly humane, which indicates the author's ability for deep empathy. That's a real feat, considering the eyes she has for true darkness.\n",

So, I watched it out of curiosity assumed that I would enjoy it because everyone else did. But, It’s so basic in writing that I feel bad for saying that. Also, I feel bad for saying this but FMAB fans just do anything to keep this anime #1 and they only say it’s good because everyone else says it’s good. when others animes with the same aspects of FMAB have way better storylines, characters etc.\n",

Now for what it truly offers and it’s not a memorable experience. Not to say fmab is bad but it wasn’t as great as I expected it to be.

      " Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood’s story feels disguised as complex but it’s really simple. Now don’t get me wrong the premise is very interesting, “It is impossible to create something out of nothing. If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given. This is the law of equivalent exchange; the basis of all alchemy.”\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the story is about 2 brother’s that lose there mom (Alphonse and Edward) So they use a alchemy technique called human transmutation a forbidden alchemy technique to bring there mom back from the dead without knowing the consequences. Alphonse loses his whole body while Edward loses a leg. Since Alphonse’s whole body is gone. Edward tries to bring his brother back by sacrificing his arm and placing a transmutation on a suit of armor. They are traumatized by what happened. They’ve lost their bodies and are in search of the legendary philosopher’s stone to get there bodies back. Now as bad as there poor suffering sounds. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story becomes so predictable because of Edward he is literally a beta male (too kind person) can’t blame Alphonse for following him. Besides he’s the younger brother anyways. They’re too kind to take risks for what they truly want. Since they don’t want anyone to suffer. Really hypocritical for them to continuously say that how they’d do anything to get there bodies back. Then someone sacrificed there life and they were still the same characters throughout the series WHY?? There were so many instances where they’ve could’ve got there bodies back. If i’m correct the brothers had contact with a philosopher’s stone over 5 times. But, Since the philosopher’s stone is made out of basically already dead souls and humans wanting to die the brothers just denied it because they don’t want suffering souls to suffer. That brings me to another point the story changes midway because of there betamale act. They give up on finding or trying to use  the philosophers stone.  They now want to go find another way to get there bodies back so then Alphonse gets memories of being dead and in “the gate truth” this randomly got brought up midway and they want to perform a stupid complicated way to get there bodies back. Also there was lots dumb tropes to keep the MC alive for instance. MC was on the verge of death because he was in a fight and the fucking villains said “Aye I think the kid is badly hurt let’s save him”. What an lazy way to add a trash filler character.\n",

Now a Anime becoming predictable is not a bad thing. But, the way FMAB predictable aspect is handled makes The story becomes bland and uninteresting as shit because tension, suspense, Turning points are poorly handled that it just isn’t at all emotional it’s bland and once you think there is emotional moment it just lands a anticlimactic feeling after that. This just makes the story uninteresting. because there is no connection with how the characters are reacting.\n",

But emotionally wise they ruin it with dumb comedy during dark moments or beautiful ones making it lose suspense while the series is playing and the jokes consist of the MC being short.

That’s really unfortunate could’ve made a great MC because of what he went through. Also there were some characters used for Roy mustang’s development.

      "While FMA brotherhood offers an overall neatly wrapped full experience in anime and is a very easy anime to watch and be entertained by, it seems like many of the series'huge flaws which hurts its overall artistic quality are either being glossed over or are just not being talked about enough. In this review, I'd like to mainly address these issues and hopefully bring forth discussion. Is the anime good? Arguably, yes, it has a lot of great crowd pleasing aspects. Is it perfect and deserving of a 10/10? Sadly, far from it.  If this review sounds in anyway cynical and pessimistic, I apologize,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "for I only think the pages of praise this anime gets needs to be balanced out with a bit of honest criticism. I also felt that I couldn't give an adequate critique without using points in the plot as examples, so I'm sorry in advance for there are some spoilers included. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Firstly, I found that brotherhood was ridden with far too many lazy convenient plot devices and shonen cliches for it to be enjoyable. What do I mean by this concretely? (spoilers ahead) If you look at episode 34 isn't it too much of a coincidence that sloth showed up right when the Elric brothers did in the exact same room? Consider the area sloth has to cover and how many times he actually emerges, isn't it too much of a coincidence that he showed up at Briggs right when the brothers was at the basement? Rather than having a story which melds encounters together naturally and smoothly, we get a cheap device made purely to advance the plot on very questionable grounds. There are other examples as well where we can see characters coincidentally being brought together if you watch the anime again. This is a terrible example of bad story writing and plot advancement. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What about shonen cliches? Just count the number of times in a fight where at the last crucial moment another character shows up to hit the enemy/ally to save someone. I realize that's a really badass shonen cliche, and when used sparingly, it can be somewhat epic, but in this one, it felt too tired and predictable.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The anime is also just far too naive and the actions and consequences of its characters are far too oversimplified. Brotherhood's predecessor might have its weaknesses, but it shines in it's realistic gritty overtones, and character growth in the Elrics as they journey through a bittersweet coming of age tale. In Brotherhood, there is only the illusion of character growth as they all have their respective emotional private dialogues, but these don't wallow past melodrama and towards episode 60, the elrics, mainly ed, are still the self righteous naive kids as they were when they started their journey. They don't murder under any circumstance for one but that morality is never explored because that's too much thinking and moral ambiguity confuses the audience I guess. In the original FMA, Ed had to resort to murder because of the situation and as dark as it was, the maturity was visible and there was a lot to be taken from that experience. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Often times moral themes in this anime don't get explored beyond \"X is wrong so don't do it!\" just like that annoying scene towards the end (spoiler)where everyone tells Mustang he'll become a different person if he takes his satisfying revenge on the homunculus who's committed multiple unforgivable crimes against humanity, but never goes into depth about the nature of revenge or why Roy will become evil if he takes vengeance in this instance. The nature of Roy's revenge wasn't even an explored theme until this moment, and all of a sudden everyone gets on envy's side and turns their teeth on Roy for no other reason but to tell kids on the other side that acts like this is bad because it turns you into a fiend for some reason. Was I not the only one shouting for them to end envy's life already? This was after the blunder of them not ending one of the world's most dangerous beings before by \"putting him in a jar and giving it to a girl to be taken on a far journey\" without assessing all the risks properly. The homunculi were dehumanized in contrast to the original FMA and made completely unsympathetic (save wrath and old greed) , and we are suppose to sympathize for them at the end for some reason when they were made to barely unlikable? It seems like everyone protects envy throughout the plot. There is \"explaining morality through well written actions and subtext\" and there is \"preachy\" Brotherhood is definitely on the side of preachy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mustang as well as everyone else's involvement in the Ishballan war was also not exposed enough I felt. There was not enough psychological explorations on that dark. evil event in history. In the original, there were enough time dedicated to show us the gravity of what happens during war, specifically the massacre of innocents and the guilt state alchemists have to bear, but all that was glossed over in brotherhood, and I felt the weight of war in general was not conveyed well at all when the anime had multiple opportunities to do so. (not just the ishballan war, but the civil battle at the end as well) and instead, we get shallow melodrama, plenty of light comedic relief, and not much food for the mind for us to ponder on. It feels like at times, the anime is almost afraid to be depressing. Compare Hughe's death sequence in both versions and tell me the one in brotherhood has more of an emotional impact. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Speaking of comedic relief, the chibi comedy moments in this anime really ruined a lot of potential serious moments. Often times, there was too much light relieving, there was nothing left to relieve but we get comedic relief'ed anyways. The atmospheric tones was much too inconsistent at key times where the director doesn't grip you in any major emotion for a significant amount of time.  For an anime which uses so much comedy, FMAB suffers from the curse of just not being funny. I get it, Edward doesn't like to be called short, ok, I had a chuckle the first couple of times it was mentioned, but for the gag to be in almost every other episode was just straight overkill. I found laughter more in the subtler gags such as ed's terrible design sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another naive and convenient moment was when all of kimblee's men happened to be good guys. They needed someone to rescue ed and be dependable, so hey, the two chimeras who were just trying to kill him a minute ago turns out to be genuinely good people because we'd have a dead main character otherwise. They couldn't kill the two chimeras in the room with scar who were tied up because the anime isn't dark enough to do that, so hey, Al trusted them at their word and they happened to be good people incapable of betrayal because everyone has good in their heart and just need to be trusted and the world is a great and simple place just like that! and just like that two allies were added to the roster out of nowhere because Arakawa couldn't write herself out of that predicament any other way.. changes of hearts are not gradual and realistic, but are rather handed out like Jesus pamphlets. Scar didn't have a second thought when the elders in his tribe whom he trusts questioned his actions, but switches sides just like that when he meets an ishballan soldier for the first time? I'm just suppose to buy that and go along? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The author also ignores too many possibilities regarding the use of alchemy while writing this. In an anime about alchemy, you'd think it'd be used more. When Al and Marco's car got a flat tire at the end, where was alchemy? when ed and gang was fighting hoards of zombie homunculi, where was the alchemy to simply bind them to the ground or wall? when the gold toothed doctor was taking his sweet time to draw a transmutation circle, where was the simple attempt to clap the ground to disrupt it? These were all techniques shown to be utilized in earlier episodes but not used so the plot could unravel at a contrived pace which makes questionable sense. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What the anime excels in is the fluidity of fight scenes, and the masterful animation with fine attention to detail all throughout, to the point where we can see the scar on Roy's hand healing scene by scene, episode by episode. I found characters in general to be paper thin and ill characterized because the episodes were more plot concentrated (but then again so was geass, but it dedicated enough time to character exposition at the same time) .I really wanted to like brotherhood...but really walked out feeling I just watched an above mediocre shonen which doesn't break the chains of its genre down to the last cheesy, sappy line uttered by its protagonist at the end.\n",

      "FMA: Brotherhood more closely follows the story line of the original manga, rather than the original television series which featured an original story line. Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their mother Trisha in the remote village of Risembool. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys were still young, and while in Trisha's care they began to show an affinity for alchemy. However, when Trisha died of\n",

      "a lingering illness, they were cared for by their best friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to advance their alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon returning home, the two decide to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy. However, human transmutation is a taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly. In the failed transmutation that results, Al's body is completely obliterated and Ed loses his left leg. In a last ditch attempt to keep his brother alive, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bring Al's soul back and houses it in a nearby suit of armor. After Edward receives automail prosthetics from Winry and Pinako, the brothers decide to burn their childhood home down (symbolizing their determination and decision of \"no turning back\") and head to the capital city to become government sanctioned State Alchemists. After passing the exam, Edward is dubbed the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" by the State Military, and the brothers begin their quest to discover the nature of the fabled Philosopher's Stone, under the direction of Colonel Roy Mustang. Along the way, they discover a deep government conspiracy to hide the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone that involves the homonculi, the alkahestrists of the neighboring nation of Xing, the scarred man from the war-torn nation of Ishbal, and their own father's past.\n",

      "Okay, so this is only my third review at this point, meaning that my reviewing pants are still a little tight and don't cup the goods just right yet, but I'm a firm advocate of sink or swim and, this being a review of one of the most popular [and currently highest rated] shows on MAL, I figure that I'll either be met with wild success or consigned to the murky depths of obscurity.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Right, so I'd like to go into this saying that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining beacon of hope amongst the fetid mire of what counts for shounen today. My own personal\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "biases aside, I have never seen an anime that so completely earned its rating of 10 by being so consistently competent in just about every category. The merits of its predecessor, Fullmetal Alchemist, may be widely disputed, but there is no doubt that Brotherhood is one of the best anime that I've had the pleasure of watching and arguably the most well rounded shounen out there. Now, being the pleb that I am, I've never actually read the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, and therefore cannot attest to how closely the show follows it, but those of you who watched the original will find that, up to a certain point, it treads pretty much the same ground as its predecessor; beyond that point, the two stories diverge wildly with the introduction of the neighboring country of Xing [China, basically] and the squinty-eyed badasses that hail from it. On an off note, I always thought it odd that, in most anime, the Japanese characters look for all the world like young white teenagers, but when you introduce a Chinese guy, it's all \"harrows\" and squinty-eyes from there.  At any rate, the Xingese characters really put the militaristic regime of Amestris [the setting of most of the story] into perspective, but I'll get to them later.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story itself is excellently paced, chronicling the Elric Brothers' journey to get their bodies back and their subsequent discoveries about the nature of alchemy itself. This sets the perfect premise for an exciting story that explores the consequences of human transmutation and the myriad of other complex moral issues presented by something such as alchemy. It also [frequently] touches on the physical and emotional repercussions of war, and the use of alchemists as a military asset, but my favorite part of the story is perhaps that it finally elucidates on Houenheim, the boys' father, who was an enigmatic figure throughout the entirety of the original, and his curious relation to the show's behind-the-scenes antagonist [of whom, by the way, is far more interesting than the original's]. I would elaborate more on the story itself, but I'll abstain from it for fear of spoiling any plot twists or revelations, of which there are many. The only real complaints that I have are that FMA:B suffered once or twice from your typical stilted anime dialogue and odd anime morality. This isn't to say that the characters weren't all consistent and believable in their decision making, they really were,  but there was one point where a character, in an incredibly justified fit of rage, was about to kill someone who clearly deserved to die [that he'd been looking for throughout the whole show in fact], but was stopped. Why? Because afterwards he \"wouldn't be the same.\" I imagine not; he'd probably have quite a load off his chest and walk with a little more skip in his step in my opinion, but everyone else may as well have been quoting Star Wars, what with their \"if you strike him down in anger, then you’ll give in to it yourself,” as though avenging countless lives is paramount to joining the Dark Side. I'd say that scene was absolutely confusing, but it actually contributed to an interesting bit of characterization for one of the bad guys; and besides, only a Sith deals in absolutes. \r\n",
      "Another [in fact, the only other] gripe that I had was with how they treated the beginning, which, as I mentioned before, is roughly the same as the original's [which was quite dark], except for some reason they thought it’d be a good idea to throw more Cartoon Faces in there. I mean, I understand throwing in a little humor for the sake of levity when things are getting too grim, but when a girl is contemplating murder after being coerced with promises of reuniting with her deceased boyfriend, having her aim at the wrong person just to throw in another \"haha, Ed is short\" joke doesn't quite cut it. Not to mention that one of the times Al went into \"cartoon\" mode during a funny scene it struck me that he looked an awful lot like a big grey condom, a thought which I just couldn't shake off for the rest of the show. Aside from that, the story is pretty much flawless.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Interestingly enough, while Ed and Al are obviously the main duo, what with them being featured prominently on the box art, they can't really be said to be the only main characters. Brotherhood also follows a fairly sizable cast of interesting characters, showing no particular favor to any one of them, instead opting to diligently flesh out each and every one of their individual journeys; including among them an ambitious military officer's campaign to root out dangerous enemies on the inside and rise among the ranks of his fellow soldiers to the esteemed title of Fuhrer [which I understand sounds suspicious to anyone post 1945, but despite obvious comparisons, Amestris isn't Nazi Germany], to the survivor of a domestic genocide [okay... maybe it is] and his quest for vengeance, with a whole array of compelling characters in between. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I'm on the topic of characters: if you were to ask me which of those  were my favorite, I'd be a genuine loss; every one of them is consistent and interesting, and they compose what is certainly one of my favorite casts in anime or media in general. I must, however, award special merit to a few: King Bradley, for perfectly encapsulating all that is man; fearless, pertinacious, and unrepentant. Riza Hawkeye and Roy Mustang, for being the most well-rounded female character and the most relatable badass respectively. Houenheim, for having a beard worthy of Rider himself, and...\r\n",
      "Actually, you know what? Never mind, all of them were amazing. Not to mention that FMA:B sports the biggest cast of female badasses that I've seen since Black Lagoon. A few characters are necessary to mention however, such as the new Xingese characters, Ling Yao [and his guards Lan Fan and Fuu], and Shao May [possibly one of the most refreshingly competent kids I've seen in anime], who are introduced around the time that Brotherhood starts coming into its own, and add a lot of supplementary lore about the world surrounding Amestris; also the Homunculi, because I really enjoyed how most of their deaths seemed to be accompanied by some underlying theme that corresponded to their respective traits. While there is so much to love, the thing that I find most impressive about the characters is that seemingly all of them are relevant. Honestly. I can't tell you how many characters were introduced that I immediately pegged as throwaways, but come the end of the show there they are, doing things. Important things. No single character can be considered the product of bad writing and they all experience growth and development in their respective arcs, oftentimes as a result of their novel interactions with the rest of the cast. By the way, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the battles, this being a shounen and all. The animation is top notch for the fights this time around and you can tell that the development team went all out on each and every one; this show sports some of the most well animated fighting that I've seen. Not to mention that the action is pretty clever, and revolves around the use of tactics as opposed to power levels, meaning that the winner of any one confrontation was entirely circumstantial and therefore appropriately suspenseful. Every encounter is fast paced and exhilarating, and thankfully so, because there are plenty of them.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly, the music and voice acting are superb. I personally watched Brotherhood dubbed, and would highly recommend it myself, because how often do you get to enjoy a genuinely outstanding dub? I tried the sub as well and found the voice acting similarly inspired; I really only chose the dub for the sheer novelty of actually getting to listen to a competent English cast. Each voice actor did an amazing job and matched their character perfectly. Ed and Al were voiced splendidly, easily conveying an entire range of emotions, Bradley was a warm family man and a menacing leader in the same breath, you could hear Roy's pain at his past molded into fuel for his ambition for the future, and of course, I could listen to Alex Louis Armstrong FOR GENERATIONS! The music was likewise impressive; this was actually one of few anime where I listened to every single opening song, every time. The OST as a whole was grand and, though some were perhaps initially overused, I never once found the BGM to be jarring or unfitting to the scene. Brotherhood also knows when to use silence; a valuable skill that many shows haven't quite gotten the hang of. Absolutely no qualms in the audio department.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All in all, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant pool of trite shounen anime; the story is captivating, the fights are thrilling, and the characterization is exemplary. Sure it may have its flaws, like that stupid “no confirmation of [romantic] feelings [to each other] until the very end” thing that anime does, but that’s a minor thing when compared to the tour de force of competency that is Brotherhood. There’s a reason that it’s resting comfortably at #1 after all.\n",
      "I, personally, love everything about Fullmetal, for not only is it an amazing anime, full of an incredible amount of heart and soul,  but it was also the first anime that really introduced me to the beautiful world of manga, anime and Japanese culture. Whilst not being the first anime i ever watched, (dragon ball z being the first, followed by Nartuo (which i personally never really liked), it was the first anime that i completed fully. So, to my surprise, in 2010, after about a 3 year break from anime, when i came across the title Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, i was surprised that\n",

      "the story wasn't over yet, (i never had access to the internet until the age of 13, this being in 2010, and the library where i got my manga didn't have the complete volumes of Fullmetal), yet i decided to ignore it, only until recently i decided to watch it, due to my passion for anime coming back in 2013, and i gotta say, every moment, every minute was absolutely astonishing and to this day Fullmetal Alchemist will always have a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite anime. :3\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: The story of FMA:B is basically the tale of 2 brothers, Ed and Al, who after performing a forbidding type of Alchemy called  Human Transportation to bring their dead mother back to life end-up not only failing to bring their mother back to life but also sacrificing their bodies, Ed losing his arm and leg, whilst his brother AL is locked to a suit of armor. The story of Fullmetal Alchemist is rich, full of brilliant themes and ideas that at times can be absolute tear-jerkers, to dark undertones, such as genocide, corruption, lust, greed, envy and wrath. The whole story is essentially a journey to reclaim what has been lost and a chance at redemption (for example ED AND AL trying to re-gain their lost limbs). Everything about the plot to full-metal is almost flawless, the ending is absolutely spectacular leaving absolutely no plot holes. \n",

      "Sound: The music in Fullmetal is absolutely brilliant, especially the opening and closing songs. All music does a fantastic job at showing the themes and the underlining feel of the show, a chance of redemption and to find what has been lost. Over the Dub and the Sub, for fullmetal, i would have to go with the DUB, every performance is top-notch, not one bad bit of dialog, yet you can never go wrong for the 2, sub and dub, both are top-notch. \n",

      "Before I go into this review, I'm just going to say that I actually like FMAB. It is a good anime, and definitely a must watch. That said, there are just a few things about it that just rub me the wrong way.\r\n",
      "   First of all, the story. It starts out dark, atmospheric, and complicated, just like the first anime, but unfortunately the story loses most of that atmosphere about a quarter of its way into the story, where as FMA was able to maintain that feeling of brooding tension from beginning to end. The pacing is terrible as well,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "and the reason of this is also the main reason as to why the story loses its feel: the first act.  Arkawa wrote the manga in a fairly clean three part story;\r\n",
      "-the first act (which concludes with Greed's spoiler)\r\n",
      "-the second act (Briggs)\r\n",
      "-the third act (Promise Day)\r\n",
      "The problem with the first act isn't in its composition, indeed, in terms of composition I'd say that that the first act is the best of the three. Its all in the manner in which the story is told. The entire first act is blasted through in about 15 episodes, followed by a choppy, confusing transition into the second part. The rest of the story suffers as a result, as the second act is entirely plot driven with little space for development with the main characters, which in turn leads to the feeling that you're not actually watching a story as much as you are just watching people you don't care about do things for hours on end. The third act is admittedly outstanding, but there is still a slight feeling of indifference radiated by several characters and certain events take an absurd amount of time to come to pass. There is a reason for this pacing problem, that problem being that the show seemingly expects people to have watched the first series and tries not to bore them with the first act. Which is completely and utterly idiotic given the unbreakable golden rule of adaptations: never assume that the audience has seen the original or read the book. The ending is a mixed bag as well. Its undeniably satisfying, but it is also far too simple and happy for such a complex series.\r\n",
      "   The cast of Brotherhood is a mixed bag, some characters (Ed, Alphonse, Scar, Izumi, Major Armstrong) are solid, but not as good they were in the original. Others (pretty much just Mustang and Winry) are better than they were in the original due to a higher level of focus and more interesting subplots. A few characters, unfortunately, are either boring archetypes or just plain useless. May Chang and Yoki have practically no purpose in the story other than to be love interests or comedy relief. There is no depth to their characters and no real purpose (May Chang does introduce a new kind of Alchemy to the main characters, but that could have also been done just as easily by Ling giving Ed a book or something), so when they get in danger or die, the audience has no reason to give a damn other than \"Well, I thought she was kind of cute.\".  The worst character, however, is easily Olivier Mira Armstrong, and believe me (or hate me, which is probable) when I say that this character is the literal epitome of almost everything wrong with modern media. So many people these days fall in love with characters just because they subvert gender/racial stereotypes, which isn't even remotely close to being a reason to like a character (unless if you in turn are racist or sexist). Olivier Mira Armstrong isn't well rounded, has no character development other than a cliche growing of fondness towards her \"weak\" brother, and does absolutely nothing other than order others around and act like a badass (and by badass I mean backstabbing old guys and getting her ass handed to her by the dumbest character in the series). We never see Olivier laugh, cry, get scared, or do anything other. Good character my ass. As for the villains, there is some good and some bad. Pride and Kimblee are awesome, though I still prefer the orginal Kimblee. Envy is a decent one as far as generic psychopaths are concerned, and the Azula moment that he pulls against Mustang towards the end is spectacularly handled. Wrath on the other hand is a badass but forgettable, and his moment of goodness in the end felt horribly contrived. The big bad lead villain works, but is basically a less subtle Voldemort with a vendetta against God. Once again, badass, but forgettable.\r\n",
      "  As far as art goes, FMAB is okay. Some things look a bit too round (Mustang literally looks like a five year old) and Edward's hair takes even longer to get used to. The action, animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all brilliant and help ease you through the story where the pacing and the tension fails.\r\n",
      "  Overall, Brotherhood is a pretty good series, as long as you don't think too much about the ending or tha pacing or the characters. Just enjoy the ride and don't expect the masterpiece that the MAL community might pressure you into believing it is.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist, a story about 2 brothers going on a journey in a magical fantasy world, which brings us as the audience closer to the interesting idea of equal trade. “Giving something in order to get something” A very realistic idea but in this universe much more effective. To make a material out of another, a dream of the ancient alchemist to create gold and probably an idea that will occur to us in a distant unknown future. Fullmetal Alechemist is an anime I only can look kindly upon. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "7 years after the original anime fascinated many of viewer studio “Bones” decided to make Fullmetal\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Alchemist again, with slightly better graphics and more accurately to the manga and it seems like that Brotherhood is even better than the original, at least the majority of people on this website think so. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think it is quite understandable why the Brotherhood series is more popular and more liked than the original, at least on this website. It is also my biggest problem about it. On the one hand Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood had more action scenes and on the other it had a more complex but better explained storyline. That seems quite good doesn’t it? Well the problem is Brotherhood explains every detail of the story, as if the storywriters think the audience can’t think for themselves. The character constantly reminds you of several things so you absolutely can’t forget them. Half way through an episode it also has to remind you of the anime you are currently watching, with shouting its name out loud, just to make sure. This penetrating need to explain everything goes way beyond normal story explanations. Even though in some cases explaining the story by SHOWING you the story is more enjoyable in many cases it need to be TOLD, especially in anime that are character based and have a lot of conversations involved. Sometimes a story gives you the clue “A” and the clue “B” and you have to come to the conclusion “C”, sometimes it gives you a clue “A” and the conclusion “C” and you can, if you want come to the result “B”.  “Brotherhoods” doesn’t do that, it gives you everything and the character just screams the conclusion out as if they can’t wait until you know their secret plan. I mean what is the secret behind something you tell everyone? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "It just bothers me when villain out of no reason start telling you their whole plan, or what evil stuff they already did, especially when they don’t need to. Why would they do that? And when they tell you everything about their plan why do they stop there? Why not telling the audience WHY they did that, WHAT motivations they had? Maybe going a little bit into the depth of characters? Sadly we dont get any of that in this anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But let’s go to the analysis: \r\n",
      "The story had a more immature writing style. It’s not only the already mentioned dragging you in only one direction and don’t allow any open mind believe that make this anime immature there are more than just that point. The representation for example was very childish. You can’t take a show seriously that constantly includes comedy parts, with a funny artstyle, which doesn’t even spare villains. From the story part, compared to the original there isn’t any uniqueness anymore. The anime really tries to be in the shounen genre since it lacks of consequences, motivations and logic in many cases. Even though this anime explains everything there are still many open question to it, which are very important once, maybe even plotholes or contradictions and not some simple questions like in the original, which are a matter of your own creativity.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pacing for the show changes a bit. First it starts of very fast, as if it wants to go through the story that the original had as fast as possible, and then it comes to a normal pacing. Besides the fast start the pacing was quite enjoyable. The start was a pretty important and emotional part in the original. But Brotherhoods because of the rushed pacing doesn’t manage to create the same effect as the original at the start. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like I said before the animes main thematic is equal trade. It was everywhere in the original.  So many little details were made, from the beginning to the ending to bring this realistic idea which was presented in a fictive style closer to its viewers. The “Brotherhoods”-series lacks so many of these points. At the start you can see it, but the more the story progresses the more it goes lost until it’s completely forgotten in the end. It is unbelievable that the writer of the manga doesn’t even get the point of his own manga, why else would he make such a consequence free story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The anime is also very popular because of its action scenes. But they are way too uncreative. Think about it, in this world they could make every material out of everything (at least they make steal out of stone, so silicon into iron + carbon(you also have to consider the high temperatures that have to be created), which is already hell of a transformation) It is idiotic to fight just with your “sword” when you have such an ability. You could create a vacuum or make the bottom liquid and then trap them. There are sure even far more greater ideas than that. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood not only wants to be shounen it also tries as hard as it can to be accepted for mature audience as well. The unfitting and forced inclusion of dark gore themes and making some appearances especially bloody, but sadly they didn’t manage to do that in terms of characters and basic of story. It’s a childish story wrapped up with mature themes, explained to the audience as if they were kids. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "A very big shounen inclusion and a very annoying story-part is the love story they written into it. In the original the fact that the blond mechanic chick is so unimportant to Ed is a very nice thing. It’s a story about 2 brothers going on a journey not a typical love story. Therefore the inclusion of such a thing only makes it feel like the storywriters tried as hard as they could to make it appealing to as many viewers as they can. And dont get me even started on how bad the consequence free, deus ex machina ending was... but it was pretty fitting for a  shounen anime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character are written more to appeal to a younger audience as well. You can clearly see that. Ed and Alfonse act only a little bit differently than in the original but its significant change made there. In the original they had childish attitude and believes, but unlike in shounen anime the show doesn’t give them the opportunity to change the world. The thing that bothers me about shounen anime is the fact that the storywriters take a childish main protagonist who thinks that he alone could change the world and the storywriters give him the ability to do that. The drama in such shounen anime is reduced to pathetic written melodrama and the invention of motivations hasn’t been done in any kind of way. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But let’s go back to the protagonist and his brother. The thing is, in the original they followed a goal which they wanted to accomplish with everything they did. The grow over the duration of the show and get more mature. In brotherhood they rather help everyone out, what makes them common “hero-typed, being nice to everyone, expect for the bad guys”- characters. They never grow and never learn anything or change their behaviour.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the other characters in Brotherhood are either annoying or unfocused or badly written. You have for example arrogant, very little knowing characters as the “good” guys, whom the storywriters use to explain the plot to the audience and we got emotionless, unmotivated and idiotic enemies who have not the slightest abilities to come up with a working plan and therefore aren’t able to create any threat to the audience.\r\n",
      "Just look at Van Hohenheim. In the original a serious guy with a goal, for which he even could make sacrifices to achieve it. And a caring father for his children, while keeping his distance. He has his secrets which makes him interesting. In Brotherhood: A typical whiny guy, who cant see anyone dying and who wants to save everyone, without goal and with a past that is completely idiotic.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also have to mention the homunculi, which are a very important group of character. For those who doesn’t know the original: The homunculi are the anti-heroes or the enemies if you like. The original gave them background story and motivations. Normally I don’t think it is important for an action based anime to go into the depth of characters especially villains, but besides the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist has a lot of character conversations it’s also every time a nice thing to do. In this case it feels also very special, since the homunculi represent the 7 deadly sins. Everyone acts like the deadly sin he represented which makes everything quite accurate and detailed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The homunculi are now in brotherhoods not only rather unimportant but completely forgotten in terms of personifications, depth, motivations and everything else that made them likeable in the original. They have no background story or any kind of focus. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The homunculi don’t act like the deadly sin they represented anymore. Envy acts arrogant all the time only saying he is envy, but there is no explanation why. Greed also has to tell the audience that he is greedy else you wouldn’t know. The characters have to tell you what they are, they can’t SHOW you.  The whole story has to be told to you to explain it and can’t be shown to you. And Wrath said something like: I’m proud of being a homunculus. Sloth is the worst of all because he is working overtime. In fact Brotherhood doesnt have any vilains that are interesting, or that could create any sort of threads. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Artstlye and soundtrack of \"Brotherhood\" were very good.The animations looked clean and the backgrounds and characterdesign was very well and detailed drawn. \r\n",
      "Soundtrack was better in the original but \"Brotherhood\" had a lot of nice tracks as well. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion Fullmetal Brotherhood was an enjoyable anime and maybe it would have been even a decent one, if there wasn’t already an anime that is the same thing, only superior in every important aspect. Brotherhood only shines in the shounen aspect with illogical inclusion, annoying overused character, lack of motivation or any kind of uniqueness and plotholes unable to count.\n",
      "Have you ever gotten that feeling of overwhelming sadness once you finish an anime/manga because you know there will never be another one like it in its genre? That was the feeling I got when I finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the controversy of the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime deviating greatly from the manga, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created as a completely faithful adaptation of the manga. Despite being a shounen series, Brotherhood adopts a unique, more mature approach to action shounen anime while still retaining the basic qualities of the genre.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The series takes place in a small, but powerful country called Amestris that mirrors Nazi\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Germany. Amestris is a militaristic totalitarian country in which its most powerful figure (well, sorta) is the head of the military, addressed as Führer. There are many other historical references, including imperialistic desires, trench warfare, and an event similar to the Holocaust, and they help us to understand the situation Amestris is in at the start of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story follows the journey of teenage alchemists Edward and Alphonse Elric, brothers determined to get back their original bodies after a deadly accident following a failed Human Transmutation. As they try to find the legendary Philosopher’s Stone, an all-powerful item that can purportedly return them to their bodies, it becomes apparent that this mysterious object is tied in to every single conflict Amestris has been in. Unlike other shounens’ plots, which are tailored to maximize fighting, FMA’s plot is intriguing and full of genuine suspense. At its core though, the series is an endearing story about the resilient bond between two brothers who’ll never give up until they achieve their goal, despite seemingly impossible odds and obstructing obstacles.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the series, alchemy is a blend of supernaturalism and chemistry that essentially takes an object and changes or transmutes it into a different object. A highly practical ability, alchemy can be used for medical purposes, fighting, building, etc. As an aspiring science major, this is one part of the series that really impressed me. For instance, there is a scene where Ed is forced to fight a character that can shield his body with diamond, one of the hardest substances on earth. After realizing the makeup of the shield, Ed transmutes the diamond into graphite (both are allotropes of carbon), a much more brittle substance. All the carbon atoms were still present, but now they were rearranged to weaken the shield. The incorporation of chemistry gives the fights so many possibilities. The Law of Conservation of Mass is somewhat applied to alchemy in the concept called Equivalent Exchange. Whatever the amount you use is the amount you receive. Of course, one of the powers of the Philosopher’s Stone is the ability to defy this rule of Equivalent Exchange, a reason why it is so coveted.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Much of the fighting in this series is relegated to close combat (until the final battle). Usually, the combatants are armed with some type of weapon, or if they’re alchemists, they can also transmute projectiles. But sometimes, the fights are as simple as hand to hand combat. Few people have truly unique abilities, especially since most fighting alchemists have similar abilities and the normal people can’t use any supernatural abilities anyway, so you won’t see crazy destructive powers like those of Naruto or Bleach. However, don’t misconstrue the fights to be any less exciting. The action is just as exhilarating, and with the inclusion of alchemy, we often see incredible environmental manipulation. Strategy is important, so the alchemic principle of understanding is sometimes crucial in fights. However, as a shounen that is more plot-driven than most, some of the fights are rather one-sided. After all, fights are supposed to be decided quickly, not take up several episodes and waste our times. Many of the fights serve to advance the plot, so more than anything, we see character development and learn more about the events preceding the series during these fights.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are easily the best part of the series. There are many of them, and they all serve specific roles in the series. The most important ones are given fleshed-out backstories, and through these, we learn about their unique personalities, values, and internal conflicts, as well as get a sense of what exactly happened to lead up to the actual events of the series. Each character has some sort of goal that they hope to achieve, be it a return to a previous life, revenge, becoming the next Führer, or achieving immortality. The main antagonists of the series are the Homunculus, an immortal group of near-invincible creatures with human exteriors. There are seven of them, each one representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and much of their personalities and goals are based upon their respective sins. Their mysterious “Father” is the one who created them. These characters are far from one-dimensional. Their psychological conflicts and emotional backgrounds really help you empathize with them. In fact, Fullmetal Alchemist has spawned a number of my favorite characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, despite all the praise I’ve given to Brotherhood, it does have a few setbacks, although whether these can be called setbacks depends on the viewer. The show often likes to resort to light-hearted slapstick comedy typical of a shounen series. Accompanying this is the occasional use of the chibi style of art. Some people may find this aggravating, although I personally have no problem with it. Also, the pacing of the series is somewhat inconsistent. Initially, the series moves rather quickly, resolving conflicts in only one or two episodes. At times, this gave the series an episodic feel. However, the pacing becomes much more streamlined towards the middle. Towards the latter part of the series, the pacing slows down considerably, and the final arc pretty much occurs within the span of a few hours. Again though, I found no problem with this personally, and the way the show was paced at different parts worked well with the occurrences in the plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The music is very suitable for the atmosphere of the show, giving an eerie, serious, ethereal, heartwarming, tragic, or lively feel depending on the scene. It’s not exactly memorable though, but it works. All the OPs and EDs are fairly good as well. On the other hand, the voice acting is perfect for the characters, especially Ed’s voice. Emotions are flawlessly conveyed through the voice actors. The animation is also fantastic. The fight scenes are exciting and flow well. No choppy movements. Occasionally, the faces do look somewhat disfigured and disproportionate (often times Mustang’s), but other than that, the artwork is detailed and generally solid.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience. Its world is so intricate, but gradually, everything is explained in full detail, and it truly is beautifully crafted.  This isn’t just another shounen anime. Its incorporation of political, religious, psychological, and philosophical elements and its focus on plot over fighting definitely make it a much more mature series than your typical shounen. At the same time, its slapstick comedy and grand fights are the reason for its shounen tag, but that’s not a bad thing. Also, this is the only action series that has invoked any serious emotion in me, showing that I actually cared about these characters. It is unfortunate to see it end, but all good things must eventually come to an end. This is a shounen that’s done right.\n",
      "I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good to watch. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric and Roy Mustang & the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it is not as impressive as the first half.\r\n",
      "Anywayz, Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy. \r\n",
      "And I will finish by saying that if you are going to watch one anime in the entirety of your life time, Choose FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood\n",
      "People tell me that I am too old for Japanese cartoons (those people are specifically idiots that prefer to say cartoons rather than anime). Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood aired 5 years ago so it classifies as an old anime but get this, I am never going to be too old and too late to watch FMA: B. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some reason, otaku members in MAL may or may not be tired of seeing reviews that has a score of ten in FMAB. To those who are sick of seeing reviews like this saying how awesome Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is, well you guys better get used\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "to it. After all, this show is by far the most epic thing I have ever seen in my entire life and I’m not just saying that because I am a fandom of it. The moment I first watched it, I was completely addicted and it became my instant favorite. (You may want to skip the third paragraph because I went through a long way before watching FMA: B but if you are interested on the story, fine with me.)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Okay, this anime was never my decision to watch and it comes with a whole journey of doubt. Last 2010, I was amazed after seeing Soul Eater and I became a huge fan of it. I used to go to this website called animecrazy.net (You guys may never heard of this website but it was removed some year ago or years ago) and it has this section called “Most Popular Anime of all time” and every time I view it I see Soul Eater at number 9 which makes me happy; however, as months pass, it goes to spot #13 and I was completely mad and to think the anime that beat Soul Eater was Fairy Tail and Full Metal Alchemist/Brotherhood. I had a huge grudge on those two shows so I promised that I will never betray Soul Eater (hardcore fan girl right?) but that assurance was broken until now. I watched shows that were really crappy before seeing Full Metal. For example, 12 anime shows that completely tell nothing but friendship and getting a boyfriend and some shows with potential but with plot holes and open endings. I never really felt so bored. Not even a single anime left me with an incredible impression for the reason that most of them never gave me a superb feeling like what SE handed me years ago. Until one day, I was watching Baccano! And saw a recommendation about Full Metal so I did it and broke my pledge. I deceived SE but I never thought that it was going to be my best decision EVER!\n",

      "Full Metal Alchemist has a great story because each arc has a connection with one another. The first arc is the goal of getting Al and Ed their bodies back. The second arc is the villain’s plan which I will not tell you because I am not going to be a spoiler. The third arc is a clan’s mission in finding immortality in order to save their culture. The fourth arc is the anti-hero’s plan of seeking revenge on the military. If you think that’s all, think again. There are more back stories, more characters to invade, more unexpected happenings and more development on every character’s relationship. What makes it unique is that it uses Alchemy which is an ancient part of Chemistry (which is being taught to students of our era). Alchemy for some people claims to be magic of some sort but believe it or not it helped produced Chemistry that we know of today. This show is mainly talking about alchemy and it made it look so damn good. Some people will think that it’s going to be a boring show because it talks about a philosophical science but it is more than that. There will be a unexplainably awesome adventure for you guys with comedy, drama (lots of it), action, and surprisingly, a little subtle romance. I give the plot an outstanding 10 because face it, Arakawa-sensei made a story like no other. It is unique, incomparable and marvelous in a million levels. Sure, people will think that I am exaggerating a bit and yes there are flaws in this anime like there are some cliché ticks; nevertheless, it is quite different because there are no fillers and Brotherhood is straight to the point, a little fast paced and of course, the episode that capped everything is undoubtedly superior and satisfactorily complied with my expectations and even surpassed it. \n",

      "Aniplex and Funimation had become popular in every anime show. Both organizations never fails to amaze me with their techniques when it comes to graphics but I won’t lie, the art is just very good and it did its best for a 2009 show by depicting very iconic styles and motifs. The background can be a little simple like its lacking details and animation. The colors were just nicely done. They know when to make a vibrant scene and a when to put a shadowy effect. Everything was just balanced and pleasing. People may observe it as mediocre but it did a splendid job for the graphics. Considering how it has a more modern impact unlike the original 2003 FMA, it also has great animation schemes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the best points in FMA: B is their OST or original soundtrack. Every anime that has Bones as their producer really has excellent music that you won’t absolutely ignore (take OHSHC, CB and SE for example). For the opening songs, my biggest recommendation and the song that I really liked is Yui’s Again. It has a rather lavishing drama and courage mixed into it. It has a dramatic entry at first but it has a catchy tone in the latter part of it. The third opening, Golden Time Lover is also convincing and fun to listen to because it has rock music and it is also upbeat and likable. The fourth opening is great too, Period by Chemistry has a slow and not too quick rhythm but it uses electric guitar as its main tune. The second opening is full hope and has more happiness into it. Rain is just too all over the place but the video that comes along with the song helps. It is good but it just wasn’t notable for me. The endings were just as grand as the OPs. The best among the rest is Miho Fukuhara’s Let it Out (which is better than Frozen’s Let it Go) because it is the song that never gets out of my head. It is very iconic and very dramatic. It made me cry so hard every time it plays with a very sad moment in FMA: B. I loved it so much and is willing to make it as my favorite Otaku song. Uso, Shunkan Sentimental, and Ray of Light were all good and aspiring to hear. The blend of RnB and Alternative Rock was splendid (am I right). For Tsunaida Te, I disliked it because of the rap that goes along with the piano it didn’t blend with the slow and steady melody. For the sound effects, some were quite repetitive but hey, that’s what makes it iconic and memorable. When it plays somewhere you’ll know that it is Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood’s soundtrack. The voice actors were flawless. They placed all the great emotions at the right time and the right place. Whether they need to be funny, sad, and emotionally fine they did it at the greatest quality as possible. Although, I am not fond of the English dub in many anime shows, FMA: B’s English dub was distinct. The Japanese dub is great too but the English dub was more hilarious. I was just a little concerned with Ed’s voice in the Japanese dub because Paku Romi is good at Edward’s younger voice but when Ed became a little older, she should’ve made her voice a little deeper but no sweat, she is a girl after all. In the English dub Vic Minogna’s voice was flexible at all costs. Kugimiya Rie and the English dub actors of Alphonse did an exceptional job (they were too many I can’t distinguish who was who). The others were awesome too making this anime lively and entertaining. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters are also one of the strongest potential of Brotherhood. Of course, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric were a great main character duo. Both were entertaining and somehow have various personalities. Individually, they are different but both are awesome protagonists. The supporting casts were explicit from Roy Mustang to the villains. I didn’t hate any character in this anime. Each and every one of them was lovable and funny. Yeah, so some of them have the common personality like the pervert, the overly protective main character and the defenseless girl but somehow they are all fantastic when seen together and they also have unique characteristics. (Take Note: I mistook Edward as a girl and Al as a robot, I am so stupid, am I the only one though?)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If giving enjoyment an infinity I would've done it by now but sadly it’s only a ten. This anime has outstanding puns, dramatic parts, a little romance, overwhelming action scenes and an ending that no words could describe my feelings because it was the best one. (Thank you Arakawa!) FMA: B was the first shounen anime that made me cry. There were episodes that were just too intense that I never expected to shed a tear. The jokes were funny and were not corny. Yeah sure some of it was always shown but they place the jokes at the right time without confusing the person and making the viewers say “what the hell am I watching?” There weren’t too many ecchi scenes in Brotherhood because like I said it is pretty straightforward. Action scenes were not too dull. They preserved the specialness in every character’s strengths and weaknesses in order to give out their true power in the end. Romance? Well, I can't believe that it has one but don’t worry, the show doesn't focus much on the love story.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a great story line, lovable characters that you won’t forget, unmistakably exquisite music and sound effects, a different art and amusing parts there is no denying that you should really NOT miss FMA: B. I am not saying this because I am a fan, I am saying this because I am a victim of watching an extraordinary anime that never left my mind. I was thinking about this anime for like weeks now and there isn't a second or a minute that I never wait for the next episode. I will always admire this anime because of its strong capability to make a person learn about sacrifices and pain. Life is cruel but in the end, you’ll know that everyone needs to lose something to gain what you really want. Just like what Edward said, “A lesson without pain is meaningless” so you have to stand and endure it. You shouldn't miss Fullmetal but instead have the time to watch it and you will be captivated. It wasn't ranked as number one in MAL for no reason. Because of FMA: B, I finally learned to move on and keep moving forward. If you haven't watched it yet, you will lose half of your life and your limbs.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood is one of those anime that can be called ”unique\". FAB is an action,adventure,psychological,thriller,drama,comedy anime also having a slight touch of romance.

      "The anime seems to be a perfection in whatever way you look at it. Especially, in sound. The voice given to most of the MCs are top notch and it matches the characters. Also, I think the English Dubbers did a good job, mainly Edward Elric's voice actor.\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood is an anime having its own class. A mind blowing piece of work that can make everyone satisfied of their life. Personally I think FAB is a hundred times better than FMA. So those who haven't watched it till now can go ahead and watch it and I garuntee you that at the end of the series you'll definetly say 'AWESOME'..\n",
      "You've probably heard of Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood, as it is widely known through the anime community as a fantastic and incredible anime. The main rule of this anime is of Equivalent Exchange; To gain, something of equal value must be lost.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, what's the Story?\r\n",
      "The story follows brothers Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric in a journey to find a mythical gem known as the Philosophers Stone in order to bend the laws of alchemy and receive the bodies they lost trying to bring back their mother after her death at the hands on an illness. That is the basics, though the second half of the anime is\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The sub and the dub are both amazing, and the dub is one of the best ever for any anime, every character's voice is great, well used and memorable. Not a single voice sounds wrong. Every character sounds exactly like you'd expect them to and it makes the entire anime a lot easier to watch as well as a lot more enjoyable, creating a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation style is incredible, fluent and beautiful. It works perfectly, and somehow they use the same animation style effectively no matter what emotion they are attempting to convey. Comedy. seriousness and sorrow are all presented fantastically\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This anime is easily one of my all time favourite anime, and I have yet to meet someone who genuinely dislikes it. It's worth a shot, and I know you'll fall in love with it, just like I did. Watch it all and there will definitely be a least one character you love and at least one part of the story you will always remember.\n",
      "The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a fantastic anime back in 2004. It had a fantastic story, and amazing characters, but unfortunately, the pacing was slow, and the ending was somewhat bittersweet. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, it's remake, on the other hand manages to fix just about every problem the original had, and even manages to improve all the good points from the original.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of the Fullmetal is one not to forget. The story revolves Edward Elric, and his brother, Alphonse Elric, who are searching for a way to return back to their original lives after committing a dangerous taboo, human transmutation. The story revolves around\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "the idea that in order to receive something, you must sacrifice something of equal value. The brothers live in a fantasy-like militaristic nation that has a great focus on the use of alchemy called Amestris. This is an incredible story that uses it's time wisely, with just about every moment having a importance in the grander scheme of things. Not everything is as it seems, as they are some really clever plot twist you won’t forget. Despite the fact the the story is massive, it never seems to complicated. It explains everything in a way that it doesn't talk down to you, but you never feel like you've been given to much info to keep track of either.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The best part of the anime by far, are the characters. The show has a huge cast of likable characters, each with own interesting personalities. None of the characters feel like stereotypes, and they are all given enough depth to make them feel alive. There’s the main dou, Edward and Alphonse Elric, two brothers who are searching for a way to get their original bodies back, and their childhood friend, Winry, who is always making sure the two brothers are safe. There’s also the members of the military, Roy Mustang, a man who wishes to become the fuhrer of Amestris, with his devoted team, and a loving father and husband, Hughes. And, of course, the antagonists of the show, the mysterious homunculi whose motives see, unclear at first, and a man looking for revenge, Scar. I haven’t even mentioned the side characters. Ninjas, Alchemy teachers, engineers, and a runaway father. Hell, I don’t even know if I can call these side characters. They're all so important, with their own different goals and character development, they could be considered all to be part of the main cast. They are all so varied, you’re bound to have your own favorites.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation for the show is great too, although some might prefer the originals art style over this one. It looks a bit more simpler compared to the originals, but that’s mainly because the original had some fantastic artwork. I will say this, though. The animation is great and has some incredible action scenes, and nice facial expressions. The art style is beautiful as well, creating fantastic environments, with a great use of distinct colors. The animation does fall once in a while, but it’s so rare, you’ll hardly notice it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And finally, the sound. This show has a fantastic orchestrated soundtrack, with solid voice acting. The anime has five opening and ending songs, and they’re all a joy to listen to. The music complements the show greatly. Every scene is backed up by a great track, giving them all it’s intended atmosphere. It can make scenes intense or relaxing, exiting or melancholic, and most importantly, meaningful. The only complaint I would have is that some of these tracks are played too often, but it never really bothered me. The voice actors for this show are great as well. There’s not really a weak voice actor in the bunch, and some of them really do help push the characters to seem more believable. You can’t go wrong with either subbed or dubbed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can’t stop praising this show enough. The show is incredible, with practically no flaws(I tried my best to even find the few nitpicks that I did find). You’ll end up finding these episodes passing by too fast, with these 64 episodes will all hold something memorable. This is not a show you want to miss.\n",
      "FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood was released in 2009 and it is a remake of the FullMetal Alchemist, where the story takes another path and twist from the original. Brotherhood is considered to be better than the original from most of its viewers.The whole animation has deep meanings as its designed based on facts and different cultures, Its not just a random put-together. It has a good way of transmitting the anime's emotions such as comedy style and drama, and will definitely make you laugh sometimes , and other times feel sad or even cry.\r\n",
      "The anime consist of 64 episodes which by my opinion is a very\n",

      "Graphics: The graphics on this animation are much improved than its predecessor. The graphics engine changed and if you watch this animation on more than 720 p you are gonna love it! The movement is smooth and the physic in the anime are as realistic as they can considering its a fantasy world with super extra special effects! It has Naturalistic colors which will not make your eyes hurt and the design of things around is pretty interesting as well. For an anime released in 2009 it has awesome details. Characters are well designed and give you the exact face expressions depending on the situation.\r\n",
      "Art: The openings and the ending of the series are awesome as they have great music and awesome design. As every anime openings of course they are kinda spoily as they show things from the series that have not happened yet. The anime has awesome soundtracks in general where they fit perfectly on the situation.\n",

      "Plot: We are in a world where in contrary with ours the people can apply Alchemy! Alchemy is the science where you can take matter , Understand it , dissolve it and then put it back together in something different. All people there can do it pretty much , at least people that are practising the art. Out protagonist tried to follow a forbidden alchemy type when their mother passed away. Wanting to bring their mother back they applied what can be said as human alchemy. The process backfired and Edward lost his leg while his little brother lost his whole body. Edward not knowing what to do he sacrificed his arm to tie his brother soul on an iron armor. After they survived Edward had surgery to apply prosthetic parts and his brother remained as an armor. Now Edward applies to work for the military thinking that he has a chance to find a way to discover the Philosophers Stone, a legendary ingredient which will help him and his brother recover their bodies. The questions are so many that they dont know where to start looking. What are the creatures called homunculus that have the name of the seven sins? What is their connection with the Stone and the way to immortality? Will the two brother stay together until the end or will the guilt consume them?\n",

      "In General: The plot is very well made and i can tell you that it is so complete that it doesn't let you any holes or blanks when the anime ends. It is deeply mysterious and very moving in such ways that it will definitely make you cry! The plot doesn't only move around the protagonists as all characters in the series are interesting and have an awesome story. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Depth Details: The whole world in the animation seems to be Germanized as for starters there is a Fuhrer in the anime. The state alchemists are called dogs of the military and in general the story is very militarized. There is this extermination of the Ishval where i can connect it with gypsies due to their lifestyle , cultural similarities and the fact that Germany killed about 1 million Romans(gypsies) during the war and also the war on multiple fronts. There is also an obsession with the occult in the high ranking members. If you have watched the original FullMetal Alchemist you will see that at the end of the series and the movie, it takes place in Germany 1923 on hitler's age  where the German Nazis are looking for power to invade other countries.\r\n",
      "According to the writer: Arakawa has stated she didn't use any specific countries or cultures to create Amestris, but rather a combination of several European countries from several different periods between the 17th and 19th centuries and, more specifically, the changes that occurred in the Western Europe during the Industrial Revolution (with a greater inspiration in England). According to her, however, there's no implied relation or comparison to any specific country, time, or government.\n",
      "Before watching Brotherhood, I've watched the original series few years back. FMA 1 was good and awesome too, but the thing I hated about it is that the ending is not tragic and is not satisfying. So, knowing that there was an another adaptation of the series made me all curious about it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since I enjoyed watching Brotherhood, I never realized I finised watching the whole thing in just one week.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\", you may ask? Well, at the first few episodes, the pacing of the plot was pretty fast, for someone who have watched the original FMA before. But, if you were not aware of the original\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "series, maybe the pacing would be okay for you. It was not as detailed as the first series, but since there are new additions to the plot, new friends and enemies, and fuller character development, especially with Winry [who was just a minor supporting character in the original series] and of course, with the Elric Brothers, you won't bother about the pacing and embrace these awesome changes instead.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story plot was different from the original FMA; the first 6 episodes were adapted from FMA1, and the next episodes were all different. Since this plot was faithful to the manga, you'll be surprised... and happy, that there are new things to discover in Brotherhood, as I've mentioned above. The addition of the east country of Xing and the northern Briggs, and their corresponding characters, was like a breath of fresh air to the series, as we can see and expect more stories and more types of alchemy and auto-mail. Also, the origins, forms, and the battles against the homunculi were totally different too. The fight scenes were all amazing. Yes, there are bloodbaths here and there, but that's the part I love the most while watching them fight, whether by weapons, alchemy, or simply a fist-to-fist battle.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maybe the part I love the most in watching FMA is on the last few episodes. The ending was simply touching, since  Edward still sacrificed something for his younger brother, but in Brotherhood, he sacrificed something different... and less tragic. I also loved the part where Ed, Al, and Hohenheim worked together when they fought with Father, and I simply cried when Hohenheim said to Trisha's grave that he's happy that at last, Edward called him \"Dad\". The ending of FMA 1 was disturbing and not really satisfying, whereas in the ending of Brotherhood, you will love it so much you will wish for a sequel... or an afterstory perhaps.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art and animation in Brotherhood was clearer, more crisp, and lot more contemporary than the original, as expected from a recently-produced series. I'm not really that particular about how the anime was drawn or animated, but Brotherhood was one of the exemptions to it. The battles were not crappy, and I really got creeped out when the \"immortal army\" was released [the white doll-like humans] from the Central underground.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The seiyuus have done a good job in portraying their roles in Brotherhood, especially Ed and Al's. I also love the OPs and EDs used in Brotherhood, especially \"Hologram\", which was the second OP and surprisingly the last ED of the series. The background music used were perfectly synched with the scenes in a particular episode. After watching the series, you will definitely want to listen to the whole OST.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of the kinds of characters in Brotherhood-- from the heroes, supporting characters, new characters, and to the villains-- it wasn't possible NOT to love at least one of these kinds. I even loved the character of Greed, who was a bad-turned-good character, and in the end, found satisfaction from his comrades. Also, the guys from Xing were also amazing, especially May, which inspired Al to study eastern alchemy in the latter parts of the story. Also, the addition of Alex Armstrong's older sister was also awesome, and also one of my favorite new characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And most especially, I love how Winry was turned into a REALLY important character in the series, and how Ed masked his OBVIOUS liking to her.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I loved the series. I laughed with it. I cried like a baby, especially whenever Ed shows his selfless nii-san love for Al. I was intrigued with every ending of the episode, which was one of the reasons I finished the whole thing in a week. The series was not a disappointment in my part, and it made me wish that all of the other remakes would be AS GOOD as this. This is a quick recommend to my friends who love to watch shounen and for those who were familiar with the original FMA, because Brotherhood was told in the manga's point of view, and the story came in full circle in the end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Right now, I am suffering from a post-anime series depression, which I think will last a few weeks or more. It's not because the series was bad, rather, Brotherhood was too good for me to finish quickly. All my friends who've watched Brotherhood had the same feeling: the feeling of not watching any anime series for a few weeks before moving on, since when you finished watching Brotherhood, it would feel that a part of you ended with it. After watching the series, I was stunned for a few minutes, and told myself \"This is it; I finished FMA Brotherhood. What will happen next?\"\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good addition to the anime series you should watch before you die [LOL, but seriously]. If you like more action, NO filler episodes, and a satisfying ending, this one's for you.\n",
      "Full Metal Alchemist is the work of mangaka Arakawa Hiromu, and is undoubtedly her most famous work. While an anime series under the name of Full Metal Alchemist did air in 2003-2004, the actual manga itself had not finished at that point and, as a result, the ending differs significantly from the actual manga’s ending. Airing in 2009-2010, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (henceforth referred to just as FMA) rectified this. Finally viewers were able to experience the joy of the entire Full Metal Alchemist story adapted to anime format – and what a joy it is.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA is very quick in establishing an action-packed storyline, soon\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "evolving from the small-scale tale of two boys trying to find a way to recover their bodies into an epic quest to save the people of the nation of Amestris from being literally devoured, as a family of homunculi seek to gain the power of God (perhaps the Japanese ‘Kami’ is more appropriate here, as this God is more of a divine lifeforce than a fully-fledged supreme being). One of the coolest parts about FMA’s storyline, and this came as quite a surprise to me, was how dramatically the pacing slows down in the last quarter. These last 16 episodes represent only about 2 days’ worth of the story, and from this point on everything really is switched up to 11. The action definitely is amped up from this point on, but so too are the personal stories of our characters. It’s hugely rewarding to follow all the mini-storylines as they comes together for the story’s suitably epic conclusion. Without going into any spoilers, the ending to FMA was as close to perfection as I think anime will ever get.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA succeeds on multiple levels, being an accomplished mixture of the more enjoyable and light-hearted fights and comedy that a good shounen needs, with a very mature and intelligent approach to the personalities of the characters. It straddles the line between a more adult philosophical anime and a shounen anime placing action first and foremost, dedicating equal time to both these approaches. This is possible largely thanks to the concept of alchemy – the superhuman powers alchemy grants its user is almost absolute. The theme of humans playing god is heavily prevalent in the show, as is the concept of religion in general (Never is the maxim ‘advanced science is indistinguishable from miracles’ more applicable than in the case of alchemy in FMA). It’s a very compelling topic of discussion, and one happily that FMA doesn’t fail to address. The first mini-story of the show, set in the religious town of Leto, is designed to introduce you to our main characters, is focused exactly on this idea, with a healthy dose of action and drama for good measure.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without further ado though, let’s look at the characters of FMA and why it is this aspect of FMA that is truly what sets the show apart. These characters are what drive the show’s considerable runtime to be a constantly entertaining and, thankfully, filler free experience. I counted about 30 characters who received decent development in the story, an astonishing figure when you consider that’s a character being fully developed every 2 episodes!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It probably won’t come as a shock to you, but it soon becomes apparent when watching FMA that the characters were its biggest strength. This is not only due to the fact that none of them stick to the archetypes loved by many (myself included), but because of how many of the leading characters are both physically and emotionally scarred. Our main characters, Edward and Alphonse, strive to save the world, but not because it is a simple driving principle that they live by, but because they need a solution to atone for their sins. This is not an uncommon driving force in FMA: the Ishbalan war soldiers, Lieutenant Hawkeye, Major Armstrong and Colonel Mustang, are also examples of characters living with regret, as is Scar, an Ishabalan hunted by the country and determined to exact revenge on the soliders of Amestris for killing his entire race! These characters are spending the bulk of their lives having to deal with the consequences for their actions. \n",

      "This is why the primary villains of the series, the homunculi, are so much more important than just punching bags. Each homunculus is named after one of the seven deadly sins, and overcoming and defeating the sins that our cast bears is brilliantly exemplified by the action-packed battles with the antagonists. These details add fantastic depth to what could easily have been a very plain ‘stopping bad-guys trying to take over the world’ situation. In a normal shounen anime, I would normally say overcoming enemy after enemy is not the same as character development, but in the case of FMA, it very much is. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist makes full (hehe) use of the wonderful opportunities the writer has set up to allow the characters to flourish as humans, not just ideals with bodies or walking plot devices. As a result, the tragedies that befall these characters are not only obstacles for them to overcome. No, they are genuine disasters that scar these characters in longer-lasting and character defining ways. It is the way that the characters are shaped by the actions that surround them that gives them such relatable and loveable traits. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I won’t spend too long on the animation and music section of FMA, because this review is getting long enough as it is! The sound and music of FMA is something I regularly look back on fondly, because there’s not a moment where it slips up. Voice acting is perfectly cast, and Edward’s squeal when someone calls him short never gets old. The theme songs for FMA are also consistently on point, starting strong with Yui’s fantastic ‘Again’ and never looking back, especially impressive due to the fact that FMA switches up its OP and ED a total of 5 times in its 65 episode running time. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "By contrast, if there’s one thing that Full Metal Alchemist doesn’t excel in, it’s the animation. It does the job and is pleasing to look at, but isn’t anything that you would write home about: character movements are smooth and some of the alchemical constructions are pretty impressive, but that’s pretty much that. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "To wrap-up, FMA is that rare breed of shounen anime where the difficulties the characters face are solved by brains sometimes just as much as they are by brawn, but FMA doesn’t stop there. The characters are all likeable, well-rounded and intensely well-written people. Such is the complete quality of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood that, over the course of writing this review, my analysis of the characters and their situations has led me to respect them even more than I did having just finished the series for a second time.\n",
      "So in honor of FMA Day 2014 (I know I'm a bit late), I've decided to write a review for my #1 all-time favorite anime (and manga), Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Honestly, I don't know what I could say about this show that hasn't already been said, but I'll give it a shot anyway.\r\n",
      "I'm not going to do what I typically do for a review which is listing the categories and what score I gave them; just know that everything is 10/10. \r\n",
      "I'm also going to address some critique that I've seen of the show and why I agree/disagree with it.\r\n",
      "Also I'm avoiding talking about the 03\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "anime because as far as I'm concerned it doesn't exist.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I apologize in advance for this wall of text.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of this show is absolutely phenomenal. Not only does it manage to tell the story of the main two characters, Ed and Al, it also gives ample time to all the other characters to show where they come from and how they think. And the show does this all without losing steam or taking long breaks from the action, and also without having characters monologuing in the middle of fights. There's also plenty of comedy, but it never once ruins the mood of the show (cough cough Pandora Hearts).\r\n",
      "People like to bash on the rushed beginning of the show, but the reason for the rushed beginning is called Fullmetal Alchemist 2003. Brotherhood quickly sped through the episodes that the 2003 anime had already covered because the good stuff was yet to come. If the pacing at the beginning isn't appealing to you, I'd suggest also watching the corresponding episodes of the original anime. That pacing is more true to the manga's. Plus, after the first 13 or so episodes of Brotherhood, the pacing slows down but, once again, without losing steam. Once the show hits episode 15, new characters that weren't in the 2003 adaptation appear and immediately take part in the story. But the new characters don't stop there. They keep appearing for a long while after that.\r\n",
      "Everything in the story is so flawlessly executed that even this type of anime isn't your thing, you can't help but admire how perfectly everything fits together and how many pains the author took in planning every step of the story. Then when you go back and watch the show again, you realize all the subtle foreshadowing that was carefully placed and not obvious enough that you pick up on it before it happens.\r\n",
      "This show is technically classified as a shounen anime, though I tend to cringe at that because FMAB isn't really a shounen. If you compare it to a more typical shounen such as Soul Eater, you begin to realize just how different it is. In Brotherhood, there's no yelling out the names of attacks, no long breaks in fights to monologue about plans, and the alchemy used isn't seen as an unquestionable staple of the world. Alchemy itself constantly called into question and many times the characters are forced to ask themselves if it's morally right to use alchemy to change the course of the world (whereas in Soul Eater they don't really debate the morality of the souls they collect). \r\n",
      "Overall, even people that don't like anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I've gotten several of my friends (as well as my dad) into anime using this show as a beginning step. If you watch the dub and ignore the obvious fact that it's animated, it doesn't seem like what people typically perceive as an anime at all. It's on a whole other level from everything else I've seen.\r\n",
      "In addition, Brotherhood sticks to the manga nearly perfectly (the only things cut out were some minor character development and comedy scenes). Considering Studio Bones has a tendency to deviate from the source material (see: Ouran, Soul Eater, Noragami, FMA 03, etc.), with this show they did an admirable job with delivering an adaptation so accurate that you can read/watch one and not have to watch/read the other, even though I'd recommend doing both because of the anime's gorgeous art and music and the manga's few forgotten moments and the slightly different chapter divides.\r\n",
      "Because Brotherhood was put into production when the manga was wrapping up, the show avoids filler episodes (possible exceptions include episodes 1 and 27, in which 1 simply introduces the characters and some foreshadowing and 27 is basically a recap episode that also provides some hints at foreshadowing). If you miss an episode of the show, chances are you'll be very confused as to what is happening. Each episode smoothly leads into the next and they're pretty much unskippable. If it's your first or even second time watching the show, I wouldn't recommend skipping even the fillers because of the foreshadowing they provide. I've seen firsthand how confused the \"fillers\" can make people while I laugh and say that it'll be explained later. And it will. Everything gets explained so clearly, yet all the subtle ways in which the plot points connect amazes me every time I watch the show.\r\n",
      "As far as worldbuilding, I give triple thumbs-up to Hiromu Arakawa. She created multiple countries and while we don't get to see too much of life back home (I still want a Xing spinoff), the ideology of the foreigners and how it conflicts with the Amestrian characters' clearly shows. On top of that, Arakawa designed a government system which plays a crucial role in the story (then again, everything plays a crucial role in the story), as well as all of the laws and finer points of how the country is run. I've seen several other animes in which the government is used a plot point, but none of them use government quite as effectively as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood does. So many side stories and spinoffs could potentially grow out of the complex world Arakawa created.\r\n",
      "Sorry for writing so much about the story, but there's a lot to write about.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The art and animation are amazing. Not as sharp as Attack on Titan, maybe, but it definitely fulfills all expectations. The battle animation is fluid and well executed, there's subtle use of CGI at certain points, the alchemy lightning is pleasing to watch, and the backgrounds are nicely detailed and do well to set the mood. Some people have said that it's simpler than the 03 anime's style, but I honestly can't see it. If anything, I find it more detailed. There's a few moments in which the same shot is used for more than a few seconds, as well as moments where the characters don't move around very much, but this is a minor detail and excusable considering the top-notch fight animation. There are no dips in quality throughout the show, and everything is handled as one would expect a high-budget anime to be handled.\r\n",
      "One of the things I especially love about the art in FMAB is the subtle aging of the characters. They age gradually, like real people, and you don't even notice the process happening until you look back on their appearances at the beginning and realize how much they've changed.\r\n",
      "In addition, the women of FMAB are completely unsexualized as well as totally kickass. After watching other animes with copious amounts of fanservice, only now can I appreciate this anomaly and not take it for granted\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I really loved the music in this show. While I felt that some tracks were overplayed in the beginning, this becomes less of a problem toward the end of the show because tunes you haven't heard before are suddenly revealed. The opening and ending songs are also very pretty and catchy (though I'm not too big a fan of the third ED), with my personal favorite opening being the last one. However, the first and fourth openings are awesome as well, and I think the first one in particular captures the mood of the show. I also loved the synchronization of some of the sequences to the songs, which I think is a very nice touch.\r\n",
      "As far as voice acting, I've seen this anime both dubbed and subbed, and while I like the dub more, both versions are really good. The actors are spot-on as their characters, and I love how they managed to get most of the voice actors from the 2003 anime back for Brotherhood. Even Alphonse's '03 dub actor, Aaron Dismuke, came back, though not as Al because he was too old at that point; instead he voices a minor but important character. Overall, the voice acting in both English and Japanese was really good, and it's safe to go with whichever one you're more comfortable with (though personally I'd say go with the dub because that way you can concentrate on the pretty art and animation).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are simply outstanding. Not only do they all get their backstories thoroughly explored, they all develop and change throughout the show. I've seen a lot of people griping about the fact that the show pretty much completely changes themes from the beginning, but the theme change is BECAUSE the characters changed. Wow, characters can change? Like real people?! I had no idea!\r\n",
      "Whenever I'm getting people into this show, I tell them, \"If you see a character that you kind of like, don't worry, because their backstory will be explained.\" And they always seem kind of doubtful, but in the end they realize that it's true.\r\n",
      "Another reason why I hold this show in the highest regards is that there are many different races, cultures, and religions being portrayed; and while some characters make racist comments, the cultures themselves are treated with the highest respect. The episode detailing the events in Ishval is one of the most grim of the show; the Ishvalans being handled by the story as carefully as if they were a real race.\r\n",
      "The romance in this show develops subtly and beautifully and never once hijacks the plot. In addition, while it's amusing to watch Ed and Winry struggling with their feelings for each other, Ed does something pretty atypical for a protagonist: He blames himself for making Winry upset, and not because she got mad at him, but because he knows he should have been there for her. It's not all that often you see the male protagonist apologizing for causing the female protagonist grief.\r\n",
      "On top of how well-rounded and three-dimensional all of the characters are, they're all very well designed. Each one of them looks and moves differently according to their personality, and a lot of the characters change outfits regularly (which doesn't seem like much, but it's the little things that count, especially considering most animes don't do this and a lot of them have some kind of uniform, school or otherwise, to avoid having to have the characters changing outfits).\r\n",
      "All in all, every one of the characters in FMAB leave a lasting impression on the viewer, whether they were in the show for one episode or all of them. It's so hard to pick a favorite.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even though this show, at 64 episodes, is the longest anime I've seen yet, it's such a fast watch that it honestly doesn't feel like it. While I personally haven't set any records with the speed of my watching, friends of mine have finished the show in time periods from 2-4 days, because of the sheer addictiveness of it. And the show IS addictive. Every few months I get a strong urge to rewatch it and cry all over again. And while I'll never completely forget every detail, every time I rewatch it I'm still blown away. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This show draws you in with the seriousness of the story, the depth of the characters, the gorgeous art and sound, and pretty much every other detail you can think of. To sum it up, if you want a viewing experience on a whole other level from anything you've seen, if you want an ending that will make you break down and rethink your life, if you've seen the original FMA and enjoyed it, watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's not the #1 rated anime on MAL by accident, and it'll definitely always be my #1.\n",
      "One thing I distinctly remember about the 12 year old me was a fear of becoming a mega nerd who watched anime. I enjoyed video games but didn’t want to plunge headlong into the void I saw before me. Well, times changed and I found myself watching my first anime at a college friend’s behest. In 2011 I found myself entranced with the deep and exciting world of Fullmetal Alchemist and the story of the two Elric brothers as they journeyed to redeem themselves. The ending to that first series, however, was a letdown that shook my good impressions of the strong opening. That opinion\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "remains to this day.\r\n",
      "\tA few months later I recounted my experiences to my friend and, to my surprise, he replied that a retelling of the series had recently finished which remained faithful to the source material. After a few months, I sat down on Netflix and watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The whole time I wondered: can the series be better than the original? Could the already great relationship I encountered between the two brothers be deepened? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story:\t\r\n",
      "First, I’d like to explain the story. Two brothers, Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Elric, live in the mysterious land of Amestris where Alchemy is a science practiced by those gifted with this strange ability. The Elric brothers grow up in their hometown with their childhood friend Winry and their mother until a plague comes through the area. Tragically, their mother passes away in the epidemic but Edward and Alphonse resolve to see their mother’s smile once more. They study from books their absent father left behind and attempt to do the forbidden: bring the dead to life. Needless to say the attempt turns horribly wrong and the series then focuses on the siblings trying to return themselves back to normal. \r\n",
      "What separates Brotherhood from its original 2003 counterpart is not really apparent at first. The brothers commit the same horrible act and what immediately follows is eerily similar. When the story reaches Dublith, however, Brotherhood begins to tell a new story. The result, I am delighted to say, is an exciting epic that twists and turns throughout the whole of the mythical world Hiromu Arakawa has laid out for us. The purpose for which the two brothers fight becomes deeper and deeper without ever losing sight of what originally drove the two to join the fight in the first place; and the resolve of the Elric brothers is pushed to the limit in ways you would never think possible. The ending is especially epic as the underlying philosophy of the show comes to light. It’s amazing to see a show that does this well in the end and Brotherhood deserves every ounce of praise it gets for its story\r\n",
      "Sadly, it would be a lie to claim this story is perfectly told. Both the very beginning and middle section of the series suffer from pacing issues. To be frank, the beginning is often criticized for the choice to gloss over material covered in the 2003 counterpart.  While all the material is there, you might be wishing for just a little more explanation before the show continues at full speed. The middle section of the anime also suffers from a pacing issue, but this time it’s too slow. While it was nice to take a breather from the action immediately preceding this section, Brotherhood falters as it introduces the final set of characters that will join in the epic climax. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "24/25\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters:\r\n",
      "Probably the most remarkable aspect of the original Fullmetal Alchemist series back in 2003 was the goofy and touching bond between the two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric. The rapid back and forth between the two served as an ideal backdrop to explore the two brothers’ personalities. Fortunately this bond was not only kept with the new series, but taken to even higher heights. Seeing the two in action was truly a delight. \r\n",
      "One of the exciting things about Brotherhood was a truly diverse cast with characters that fairly consistently avoided the cardboard character models that are so easy to fall into. Minor characters that stand out include Yoki, Maes Hughes, and of course Lust. But what makes the series memorable is the diverse cast of characters with their own motivations. Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye are trying to atone for the crimes of the Ishvallan war of extermination and build a better world no matter what the cost. General Armstrong seeks to make Amestris as strong as it can possibly be and fights to make it so. And even the enemies have motivations that sum up to more than a simple “we must stop the main protagonists at all costs.” Brotherhood massively succeeds in making the story engaging through its exciting cast, and I feel as if the story is as wonderful as it is because of the well-developed characters in this series.       \n",
      "\r\n",
      "24/25\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Animation:\r\n",
      "Of course no animated series can exist without the medium of animation to carry facial expressions and convey action. To this respect, Brotherhood improves upon the solid foundations left by the 2003 series and the manga.  I particularly enjoy the character designs, but animation experts have raved about the fantastic fight scenes the series boasts. One animator, Yoshimichi Kameda, has received extensive praise for his touches and innovations in the Sakuga of several major fight scenes. Aside from that there are a few instances where the animation gets a little derpy and the chibi animation can sometimes interfere with the overall gravity of the plot; but I find it refreshing that a series so epic takes a small breather every now and then.\n",

      "16/17.5\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound:\r\n",
      "With regards to the overall sound of the show, I felt as if there was some solid work put in on the part of Akira Senju. Unfortunately, the music of the series does begin to grind on you as the show reaches the climatic final scenes. This is alleviated somewhat by the execution of the music in the show as it never overpowers the quietest moments and never is lost even in the thick of combat. One major plus in my book is the work done by Funimation in their Dub of the show. Vic Mignogna delivers again in his reprise of Edward Elric and the rest of the English cast is, for the most part, quite solid. As I am not a native speaker of Japanese I generally prefer watching the Dub when I can so I am able to more effectively judge the quality of the voice acting; and the English cast is phenomenal. If I had to comment on the original voice acting performed in Japanese I would remark that the Voice actor for Edward sounds much younger than an American 15 year old would sound… Haters gonna hate.\t\t\n",

      "Accessibility:\r\n",
      "Finally, I would be negligent to recommend or condemn this series without mentioning the appropriateness of the series to all ages. While I do feel as if the series is a masterfully told story, there are elements that prohibit me from recommending this adventure to all. Most notably the dark one and violence make this series a no go for anyone under the age of 15. If you doubt me watch episode 4 and tell me it isn’t dark. Also it seems like every shonen series has an uncontrollable urge to throw in a tub scene with the main love interest. Obviously this isn’t family friendly. While complete nudity is not an issue, this series is not guitless when it comes to the regrettable trend of fanservice and innuendo. \t\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment factor:\r\n",
      "I loved Brotherhood… Enough said, and seeing as it tells a complete story that examines and plays out different philosophies as part of its intricate design, it seems as if Brotherhood will continue to be my most enjoyable TV experience for a long time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many people have lauded Brotherhood since its completion and I am happy to include myself in their number. The sheer glory of the ending is a masterpiece that needs to be seen to believe, though the barrier of entry regrettably limits the audience of the series. For these reasons I rate Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood with a score of 92 out of 100 and grade the series as a Diamond rated show. Brotherhood is a monument to anime done well, and is a testament to a story told superbly. The combination of quality animation and well developed characters provide the perfect backdrop to a tale of two brothers. A tale where redemption is just beyond their reach.\n",
      "When the original Fullmetal Alchemist came out in 2003, it was apparent that it followed the manga at first, but them went on it's path. Which didn't make it bad, but it annoyed many people, including me (Even though I didn't watch it until about 9 or 10 years after it came out.) \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But! Our fandom had been blessed with a reboot of the series that follows the manga, and is pretty damn good. I have been intimidated to write about this series because well, it's too awesome to tackle with reviews. \n",

      "\r\n",
      "What especially loved was the fact that the story flowed so nicely, even though when I first watched it I was confused during the first 13 episodes because I had watched FMA '03 before hand. You should probably wait a little bit before diving into this series after finished the original. It may seem the same, but it's a whole different ball park. However, no questions are left unanswered, and there are a lot of feels involved. \n",

      "There's also the standard; 'Anime serious face' and the 'anime goofing off face'. EX: Ouran High school host club. I think BONES did really well, with character detail. But not so much with background animation, things seemed a bit off there. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. \n",

      "The action scenes, too, were rarely drawn out unnecessarily and were all beautifully crafted. I'm crossing my fingers that more shows will get their brotherhood, because although this series is longer than the original it felt more focused, and certainly it ended up feeling more meaningful. I may have given few hours to this show, but I feel equivalent exchange was not at play here because it has given me a lot more than I was expecting.\n",

The two main protagonist are Edward and Alphonse Elric who are excellently written as the short-tempered leader who just wants to protect who he loves in Edward and Alphonse as such a  softy who just wants do what's right in his quest for his body.  The story as I said before has excellent pacing moving from gripping drama to bits of humor to intense action seemlessly.  I'm not going to say this is perfect because it isn't some of fights lack speed and weight in the animation.  Speaking of which the animation isn't anything to write home about in my opinion keep in mind I watch this in 2014 so for its time its above average.  The sound overall is quite good the theme was carried from FMA which isn't a problem and the openings are much improved with the first standing out.  Overall its at least worth watching to get your own idea of it\n",

It follows two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric who attempted to bring their mother back to life with the most forbidden alchemy: Human Transmutation.

In a desperate attempt to keep his brother with him, Edward willingly sacrificed his right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. Edward bound Al's soul to a suit of armor he\n",

      " This plot is perfectly explained in the original anime \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". It's like they created this with the thought that everyone watched the original first. I would highly recommend watching the first one if you want more insight on the transmutation, or reading the manga version. \r\n",
      " I also criticized the art style to be a little cartoony for my taste, but gave it a  8. The style itself is clean and fresh but feels very simplistic. However, overtime when you watch this anime- one of my favorite parts is that the characters do not stay the same age. The characters grow in the story as you watch, and you don't realize it until you see the teenage protagonist actually looks like a young adult in comparison to the 12 year old you once got introduced to. \r\n",
      " The soundtrack is wonderful, it's a great listen. The openings also make the characters grow/change like in the anime. When you see them separately, and look at them side-by-side, you'll see the growth. One of the most uniquest things I have ever seen in an Anime. \r\n",
      " The characters in FMAB, are all lovely. They each have there own story/quest. In the end, you really enjoy watching them grow with the protagonists and see them help Edward and Alphonse reach there goal including there own. \r\n",
      " Overall, this anime is wonderful and heartbreaking, and will make you laugh and cry. Even though this anime has flaws, I gave a 10 because of the wonderful journey it gave me. Its truly a treat.  It's a beautiful story you will honestly never forget.\n",

      "For me it's very important that it does not only have strong male characters but also very strong female characters. I personally love animes (and mangas) that have very strong females and that doesn't go for the more typical type of female that we often see in animes and mangas. \n",

      "Best show I've ever seen.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably the best series I've ever seen. There are several reasons for this: \n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) The story is truly compelling! It really grows on you, since the viewer wants the Elric brothers to reach their goal of getting their bodies back, because of their hard childhood, where their dad left home and their mother died. You grow a sympathy towards these two boys. The plot is amazing, though I don't want to spoil anything. The idea of Alchemy is great in my opinion. So I'll give the story: 10/10\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) The art is top notch, the fighting scenes are\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "amazing and the backgrounds are beautiful. The characters are well-made and they actually seem really human, though they are animated. (Wrath's fighting scenes are awesome!) - Art: 9/10 (almost 10/10l)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) The sounds in FMA Brotherhood is good, but still the show's weakest aspect. Sometimes the background music doesn't really fit, but it doesn't bring down the show. The opening and closing songs are really good, the second opening is one of my favourite Japanese songs. The genereal sounds and talking are good as well. - Sounds deserve a 9/10 (Close to 8/10, due to the background music being out of place at times). \n",
      "\r\n",
      "4) What really made me love FMA: Brotherhood is the characters in the show. They are truly geniously put together. I am a twin brother myself, so I was really touched by Edward's and Alphonse's brotherhood, since I feel that I would go through the same shit as they do, only to help my brother. \r\n",
      "Roy Mustang is a great character, who has quite some shadows of his yesterdays hanging on his shoulders. He has killed many men during some civil wars, which happened in the country. \r\n",
      "Scar is also an important character, who was filled with hatred and seeks revenge on the State Alchemists, who destroyed the Ishbalans, who was Scar's people. \r\n",
      "Louis Armstrong is a fun character, who brings a nice humourous aspect to the show with his Gai Sensei-like emotional and masculine behaviour. \r\n",
      "There are tons of other great characters, I could go on forever, but these were the highlights to me. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "5) All the reasons mentioned above made me enjoy this show more than I've enjoyed any other show. The plot is amazingly well-written and the characters are really believable and sometimes this show just bring the chills, since you really symphatize with the characters. The ending is just perfect, so I'll give FMA: Brotherhood the biggest 10/10 I've ever given to any show.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was the first anime I ever watched, and probably one of the best. The story is pretty simple, it's on MAL so I'm not explaining it. However, I will say this, this anime is sad. You wouldn't expect it from seeing the title or a picture. But this anime is as sad as Clannad: After Story or any other anime that tries to be emotional. I recently rewatched this anime, and I experienced the train ride I had. This anime has so many unexpected moments, especially towards the end. SPOILERS AHEAD: I think that Hughes should have had a bit more screen\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "time, don't get me wrong I want to say that I cried. But the thing that made me sad were the reactions of the other characters with hughes dying. They made the aftermath perfect, but before that,9/10. A bit more and it would be perfect. You learn a lot of things in this anime, They apply to real world situations. Let's face it, when we wish for something big, we always sacrifice something. Like \"I wish for Hoenn to be remade\" Your wish comes true but you lose hope halfway. The characters were very enjoyable, the villains were great as well, Animation and Sound, perfect. Overall, my rating would be 9.9/10 which I would say is near perfect. This anime is incredible, and everyone should watch it. I may be a bit too much of a fanboy, but trust me, you'll love it.\n",
      "Brotherhood boasts that it follows the mangas story more closely than the previous anime adaptation, and it does.  However the actual quality of the anime itself is far poorer.  What realy made FMA's previous anime adaptation so successfull was the overall direction of the anime.  The quality of shots used in this anime and the art itself is inferior to the original anime.  Obviously it is still highly enjoyable due to the story behind it, but the anime seems overhyped.  People feel pressured to believe thats its better due to the story being more accuratly followed.  This is not\n",

      "FMA fanatics should enjoy this as it follows the manga more closely, however if you have not read the manga then I would reccomend the original series, as in all honesty it is of much better quality.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I fully enjoyed the original FMA since episode 1. It was well thought out. However, Brotherhood is the completely opposite. Since the storyline completely rushed, it does not allow for explanation. The characters are introduced so quickly, making Brotherhood just like any other anime out there.\n",

      "If there's one programme out there which a tad frustrating for me, it's Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely sick of seeing reviews giving this show a 10/10. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely adore Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole and I do believe that the adventures of Edward and Alphonse should be viewed by all at some point. But it's really the fans' reaction to this show that drive me up a wall. At its core, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great show that does a lot of things right (and I do mean a LOT of shit\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "right) but ends up getting some shit wrong along the way as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, it's important to understand why this show was made before I get started with the actual review itself. Before Brotherhood ever existed, there was the first Fullmetal Alchemist TV series: a loose adaptation of the manga which eventually broke away from the source material in order to tell its own story. Now, this was important for two reasons. The first is because at the time of the first series' creation, there weren't that many chapters there to adapt so either Bones had to wing it or Arakawa had to sacrifice her creative integrity and succumb to both publisher deadlines AND studio pressure as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second reason is the most important: because the first series branched off and became its own entity, that gave Hiromu Arakawa much more time to flesh out the manga's universe and go in the direction she so chooses without having to worry about things like deadlines as much. Talk shit all you want about the first TV series, but just keep in mind that without the first TV series, the manga as we know it right now would be vastly different and Brotherhood would in all likelihood not exist. Of course, the fact that the circumstances behind this show's creation rely so heavily on what went down in the first show does come back to bite Brotherhood in the ass. How so?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well for one thing, the first 15 episodes of Brotherhood are rather... \"rushed,\" I guess? Now, this was actually a stylistic choice on the part of Bones since the logic at the time of creation was that the vast majority of people who are watching this show would have already watched the 2003 series first so they didn't want to bore returning viewers by showing them the same stuff they saw before. While that certainly is a respectable goal, there's only one little problem with that logic: this is supposed to be a REBOOT of the anime series. If you're going to reboot something, any prior entries in the franchise shouldn't even be factored into the equation.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now granted, I did complete Brotherhood first before going on to complete the 2003 series and nothing really seemed out-of-place, but upon re-watching after completing the 2003 series... it just didn't really feel the same. For instance, there's the whole ordeal with Nina Tucker. If you've spent ANY amount of time around the FMA fandom, you should have *some* idea that what happens to this 4-year-old girl is NOT pretty. In the 2003 series however, the Tucker family's role was expanded and we got to see more of Nina before \"it\" happened (and let me just say that the entire thing was fucking depressing after \"it\" happened).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Brotherhood... Nina is just around for one episode and after tragedy befalls her, she's apparently one of the driving forces behind Edward and Alphonse's goals of becoming better alchemists. Let me get this straight: a little girl that you didn't even know for more than a week is going to be one of the driving forces behind our lead protagonists' goals for the entire series' run? Yeah... I'm not buying it. Yes, what happened to her is sad but I find it incredibly hard to believe that an incident like that to someone that Ed and Al barely knew would have THAT much of an impact on them. There are WAY more examples like that than I let on, by the way. I just don't feel like covering them all since that's far too much work on my end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another aspect about Brotherhood I take umbrage with is the comedy. To put it short, I don't really care much for Hiromu Arakawa's chibi-style humour since it just takes me out of the seriousness of the moment and just kills the mood altogether in a vein similar to Kuroshitsuji. Of course, that's not really a fair comparison since Bones is a far more competent studio than A-1 Pictures but it's still something to be mentioned. You can only imagine my frustration whenever I saw Ed go into chibi mode right after some intense action or a relatively serious moment goes down. I mean, yeah it gets a quiet chuckle out of me but do you really have to resort to THAT style of humour to elicit a laugh or two out of the viewers? Come on...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last thing that I don't really have a lot of praise for is the fact that despite the fact that it's definitely a cut above its competition in the battle shonen genre, it still FEELS like a battle shonen series in all the wrong ways from time to time. Don't get me wrong, Hiromu Arakawa really put in a lot of thought and effort into writing up the story and the characters but you can just tell where she got lazy and resorted to using some of the same clichés that plague other battle shonen anime/manga series. They're few and far between, but when they pop up, chances are that you'll instinctively face-palm (especially if there's some bullshit monologue about friendship; I'm looking at you, final fight between Envy and Roy Mustang >_>).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now with all that ugliness out of the way, let's talk positives because hot DAMN is there a lot of praise to give this show. When it comes down to world-building, Hiromu Arakawa is all but unmatched. The world that Brotherhood is set in is masterfully crafted, with a lot of detail put into the locations that each part of the story takes place in. It's quite evident that the biggest reason why the manga took so long to complete would be that Hiromu Arakawa spent a great deal of time fleshing out the finer details of the locations that she brings up. In fact, the only works that I can think of that would be on equal or better footing than Brotherhood would be the likes of Harry Potter, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing that Brotherhood has going for it is the adventure. I don't know about you, but I always found myself enamoured with the new locations and such that Ed and Al would come across on their journeys. From Lior to Fort Briggs and even the ruins of Xerxes, I never cease to find myself captivated by what's going on. What's more is that the adventure from start to finish (with the exception of the first 15 episodes) is incredibly well-paced. No segment of the adventure feels drawn out to the point of being tedious or rushed to the point where nothing of substance actually happens and that segment could've easily been cut out. Each part of the narrative feels necessary to the plot and is given just enough time to make its impact before we move on to the next part of the story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Speaking of which, one of the biggest complaints I see people lodging against the 2003 series is its supposed lack of action. Well Brotherhood makes up for that supposed weakness in full force. At its core, the Fullmetal Alchemist manga is a battle shonen manga and what battle shonen adaptation would be complete without epic fights? All the fights in Brotherhood are perfectly timed, so they're not hideously drawn nor are they dissatisfyingly short. What's more is that battles are only present in episodes where a fight NEEDS to go down for the sake of plot, so there are no pointless fights thrown in for the hell of it so the fights themselves don't detract from the story in the slightest.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Battles, adventures, and a masterfully crafted setting aren't the only thing that Brotherhood has going for it. Surprising though it may be, battle shonen series are actually able to have some damn good drama thrown into the mix which is more than capable of having you emotionally involved with what's going on and that's one of the hallmarks surrounding Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole. Whilst the focus of Brotherhood is more on the adventure than it is the drama, that doesn't stop the show from being able to have more than its fair share of compelling and emotionally involving moments. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last thing that I want to talk about story-wise before I move on to the characters is the ending. The biggest reason why the 2003 series is so divisive amongst FMA fans as a whole is how the series itself actually concluded. The 2003 series' original conclusion was nothing short of bitter-sweet, with a MUCH heavier emphasis on the bitter than the sweet, even in the sequel movie Conqueror of Shamballah. Brotherhood's ending is the exact opposite. It is a happy ending in every sense of the word which fans found INFINITELY more satisfying than what was there previously. As the great Nobuhiro Watsuki said, shonen series are ultimately comics meant for boys and they should have happy endings. Why? Well... boys are young. Save the depressing shit for when they're older and develop a nasty drinking problem.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If there's one area where Fullmetal Alchemist will always succeed (regardless of incarnation), it would definitely have to be with the characters. Of course with that said, Brotherhood is a more event-driven programme rather than character-driven so character development isn't really a priority. For example, Ed and Al more or less remain the same throughout their entire ordeal. They don't degenerate as individuals, yet they also don't improve or even change in any notable way throughout the entire show's run. Regardless, Ed's characterisation is absolutely spectacular.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I really love about Ed's characterisation is the fact that despite going through a great deal of strife in his life, he knows how to laugh and have fun. He rebels against authority from time to time, he and Al fight like brothers do, he has childish outbursts from time to time, etc. What I'm getting at is that despite all of the crap he's gone through, he still behaves like a teenager would. In many ways, Ed reminds me of Peter Parker from the Ultmate Spider-Man comics and that resemblance really does boost him up several notches on my likeability meter. His dynamic with Alphonse is also something that I enjoy quite a bit because it feels a bit like Terry McGinnis/Maxine Gibson's relationship from Batman Beyond.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Alphonse. Throughout the course of Fullmetal Alchemist (this applies to the manga and both TV series), Alphonse more or less remains static throughout the entire show's run and doesn't get any characterisation beyond functioning as the Maxine Gibson to Edward's Terry MicGinnis and being the gentle giant/naive younger sibling. Any sort of subplot that seemed like it would add more to his character don't really play out as such so we're basically back to where we started. Take the part where Al doubts his own humanity for instance. You'd think that would be like a REALLY huge thing, but no... it gets resolved within 1-2 episodes and Al is back to re-transmuting Ed's soul once Winry knocks it out of Ed's body with her wrench... oh well, such is life.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The secondary characters in Fullmetal Alchemist have always been of variable quality, and the same remains true in Brotherhood (perhaps even more so because Brotherhood has a MUCH larger supporting cast). Some characters like Roy Mustang, Greed, Scar, Father, and Fuhrer Bradley are REALLY well-written with their own degrees of complexity while others like Lust, Sloth, and Gluttony didn't really have much to their personality aside from being antagonists. I know that this shit is to be expected, but Hiromu Arakawa REALLY outdid herself when it came down to all this other stuff, and when I don't see that level of quality maintained throughout the work, it just leaves me feeling empty inside. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the technical side of things, Brotherhood is definitely among the best-looking shows that Bones has ever produced, but this is obviously to be expected. Bones is no slouch when it comes down to visual quality. Hell, even shows that they created more than a decade ago like RahXephon and Wolf's Rain hold up pretty damn well in 2014. If I had to sum up my thoughts on the visuals, I'd have to say that Brotherhood's aesthetics are more or less identical to the 2003 show's, but refined. Character designs are more in-line with the manga's, improvements in animation technology allow for less still frames/talking heads present, and what's more is that there's a good deal more background animation present. Speaking of which, Brotherhood's action is bar none some of the most enthralling that I've ever seen in ANY shonen anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another area where Brotherhood excels are in the OPs/EDs. It's rare for me to find an anime that I enjoy have multiple openings, all of which that I actually do like. Personally, I'm biased toward the 5th OP, as it's the opening that really just sets the stage perfectly for the final few episodes of Brotherhood. It has this atmosphere about it where everyone's weary and yet they're so close to their goal that they can't just give up now and that what I'm about to watch really is the home stretch. ED-wise, I'm biased toward the 1st ED because of the animation style as it's all-chibi artwork animated as if it were drawn in pencil with a great track playing over it. That actually brings me over to the audio side of the spectrum.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Audio-wise, Brotherhood doesn't disappoint... asterisk. Now there is one complaint that I have with the OST but that's mostly because the 2003 show's OST is among my all-time favourite anime OSTs and yet Brotherhood just didn't live up to my expectations upon re-watch. This is a similar problem that I had with Hellsing Ultimate in the sense that its predecessor's OST is superior to my ears than the OST that we have for the reboot despite the fact that the one present is REALLY good stuff. There wasn't much in the way of background music that stood out, although it did serve as a complement to whatever was going on and there wasn't anything that I personally found inappropriate for the moment at hand. My favourite OP/ED themes are \"Rain\" and \"Uso\" by SID respectively, just so I can get that out of the way.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dub-wise, Funimation steps up to the plate and delivers in full force. The cast is almost identical to the 2003 series' dub (which is one of my all-time favourite Funimation dubs, by the way), save for certain characters because let's face it: there's no way you can get the same people to work on a project they had a hand in 5-6 years ago all in one place. The most noticeable changes to the cast are Maxey Whitehead replacing Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse, Troy Baker replacing Chris Patton as Greed, J. Michael Tatum replacing Dameon Clark as Scar, and John Swasey aka Gendo Ikari replacing Scott McNeil as Hohenheim.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can safely say that Whitehead, Baker, Tatum, and Swasey all do an excellent job with the roles they were given and are on-par if not better than their predecessors... although I'm biased toward Chris Patton's version of Greed for... reasons. The rest of the dub is spot-on. Vic Mignonga, Travis Willingham, Caitlin Glass, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Laura Bailey, and everyone else who had a hand to play in this dub did an absolutely spectacular job. I'd like to hear dub haters try and talk shit about this dub, because I can't find anything wrong with it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Final thoughts? Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining example of what an adaptation SHOULD do, and yet it baffles me as to how people can consider this to be the best anime ever and something that is infinitely superior to the 2003 series. Despite my preference of the 2003 series, I'd say that they're equals. It's not often we get TWO adaptations which have VERY well-written plots and if you really are a manga purist, you can view the 2003 series as an alternate universe interpretation. Regardless, I absolutely enjoyed watching Brotherhood and I look forward to the day where I can own a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack of the entire show. Both the 2003 series and Brotherhood should be watched by all and both deserve a special place on your shelf of interesting items.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With that said, I'm out. Feedback is always welcome, as are monetary contributions and offerings of food, drinks, chromosomes and fancy clothes to the Dark Lord Chin-Chin.\n",
      "After watching Fullmetal Alchemist, I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. Everything felt rushed, and the twists and turns lacked gravitas. So it was with great scepticism that I continued on to watch Brotherhood. Quickly, my fears about this remake were dispelled and I was hooked. Four days and 64 episodes later, I'm at the end and I'm blown away.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I do strongly suggest you watch FMA before moving onto Brotherhood. FMA was good, had a lot of entertainment value, but half the things I wanted to see didn't happen - and I haven't even read the manga yet. But in Brotherhood you get everything you\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "expected to see and more.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The relationship between Edward and Alphonse feels so much more real in FMA Brotherhood. I can actually see their bond and believe that they'd do anything to get their bodies back. In FMA, I wanted to see more brotherly moments, and I just didn't get that until Brotherhood. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Winry had a much bigger role to play in Brotherhood than she did in FMA. Her interactions with Ed and Al we hilarious and touching, and the three of them really drive this story all the way. You never stop rooting for them and you never stop hoping that they can right their wrongs and get their bodies back.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another favourite duo was Mustang and Hawkeye. I loved seeing the two of them together, because they just played off each other really well. They were there for each other through thick and thin and every scene they had together was a delight to watch.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA Brotherhood left me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't stop watching, and when I had to because I needed sleep, I swear that all I could think about was FMA Brotherhood, the characters, and where I thought this anime would go. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I strongly recommend this!\n",
      "I really enjoyed this anime purely for the fact it always had me on the edge of my seat.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character development through the whole thing was absolutely amazing! seeing Al and Ed go through god only knows what all the while learning from their past experience was just mind blowing and partly one of the reasons why I really love this show. Side characters were even developed and honestly it was beautiful to see all the hard work of everyone in the FMA:B team just all fall into place mainly because of character development and an extremely gripping story line (with added side plots too\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "keep the story going)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation at first was not really my cup of *insert drink here* but slowly grew on me as I couldn't imagine the show being drawn in any other way.     \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack for the show was also one of the reasons I really enjoyed it as I'm normally one to skip intro's and outro's but the songs were just beautiful and fitting to be skipped, even after I'd heard them countless times, I still search for them on Youtube and listen to them now! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would highly recommend anyone to watch this anime even though it is lengthy but still so amazingly good!\n",
      "Anyone who does not like Deus Ex Machina and plot points that seem to be hastily shoved into place should not watch this Anime. And any fans of the original FMA Anime should tread carefully. While this is still a fairly good show there are many things that just don't work.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's always a shame to see good characters go to waste. Ed and Al are two interesting kids who will do no growing or learning over the course of 64 episodes, they began and end their journey the same as they started it albeit with a varying degree of limbs. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our story centers around a\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "generic good vs evil plot, where those that fall under the banner of evil show no real reasons or proper motivations for their actions aside from the authors needing a villain. Why do the homonculi want to help Father? Because a villain needs henchmen. Why does the Dwarf in the Flask want power? Because why not.  It's a shame the story is such lackluster since the world it's built in feels so vivid and inviting. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But even a greater shame then the villains would have to be the supporting cast of the good guys. Ed and Al don't develop or change but they are still interesting, the same can not be said for their companions. An odd medley of alchemists, soldiers, and chimera all fighting for the greater good and barely an interesting one among them. If you want to watch this series and find some good characterization, pay attention to Ling and Greed. They are the only characters that actually seem to grow, change, and have real conflict within this story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a final point I would like to say that while both FMA and FMA:B use death as a major driving force for characters FMA:B can almost be laughed at for even attempting this. Characters with no actual characterization are killed off and we are expected to see this as a shame and a reasonable excuse for a major characters actions. If your flashback scene for a character can only consist of \"Hello, I'm [Name].\" and two other boring statements with no real barring, then this character should never be used to develop major plot points.\n",

      "Story-10\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) has an fantastic story. Its pacing at first is faster then I'd expect, since the '03 FMA's first few episodes were some of its most developing, but it quickly makes up for any lack of development later on in the show. It's also has the perfect length at 64 episodes, as if it were any shorter, I'd personally think it was a bit too short, and if it were any longer, too long. Everything is great, from the emotional beginning to the truly epic ending.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art-9\r\n",
      "FMA:B is animated gorgeously. Anything from its talking scenes, to\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "drama scenes, to action scenes, all look great.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound-9\r\n",
      "I'm going to get this out of the way right now: I loved every single one of these openings/endings. They were all great songs that fit the point of the show they were at. As for the OST, its still great, but I really sense that they used the same tracks over more times than I'd like.\r\n",
      "I watched FMA:B both subbed and dubbed, and I actually have to say that I like the dub more than the sub. Vic Mignogna  does a perfect job as Edward, and everyone else does great returning to their older Characters from FMA '03.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters-10 \r\n",
      "The characters is definitely one of FMA:B's strong suits in my opinion. You feel for every character, main or side, villain or hero. All characters are fleshed out and feel real. In two different episodes, you can see Edward actually grow taller, and that's TRUE character development.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment-10\r\n",
      "I truly love this anime. It made me laugh, smile, tear up, made me full adrenaline, and all at once sometimes. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime, and probably always will be. It truly deserves everyone's enjoyment.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall: 9.5/10\n",
      "Look, I can see why this anime is really loved, but I just don't think it's that good. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "No, this is not a troll, and I think it's silly that people might think I'm trolling simply because I don't like a show, but when it's the highest rated anime on the sight I can probably come to expect some hate. But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is just not that good. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "For one, the pacing is really messed up. In the first season (12 episodes) we jump from past to present and zoom through something I can tell was probably a really important part of the story,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "and it left me with no way of attaching myself to any of the characters. Several characters die and impact the story and the mains but it's so rushed that as a part of the audience I can't find it in myself to care, really. It seemed like they were plot devices. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing I think is bad is the way things are revealed. Without getting too much into spoilers, we're kept in the dark of a character's past until some part of the story like 40 episodes in, and then all of a sudden it's dropped on us and we're expected to get it. The anime also has a lot of \"philosophical\" undertones, I guess, but the philosophies are really weak and surface level. Such as Edward in the first few episodes when he's in that town and talks to the Rose character, telling her that humans can be made with ingredients found in the town market and that alchemists are atheistic because they know these things--but Edward has SEEN god. This, also, is conveyed after the fact, which just makes it even more confusing. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And really my biggest issue with the anime is that there seems to be an inconsequential bit of tension. IT's so repetitive. Ed and Al fall apart and we all know they'll just get put back together again The whole reason Ed has automail is so that it can get wrecked in the story so he seems to be in danger. Nothing ever comes of it! By the end all the characters are pretty much the same, no development has been done, but the show has a Disney ending anyway because, for some reason, a show with philosophical undertones needs to end happily. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation was really good, and I enjoyed fight scenes well enough, even if a power like alchemy is poorly explained. It looked good all the way through, and there's no character designs I dislike either, but they use the same music tracks over and over in the show and I started to get tired of the music overall. I will say this, though, the openings and endings are pretty top notch. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "So overall I didn't really like this show at all. My biggest thing is that I think this show has a high score because it came at a time that anime was booming, and it successfully adapted the source material in a way that the original failed to do. You know everyone says \"the book is better than the movie\" even when the movie was good? That's because, for some reason, people just think the thing that came first is better. So when a bad show is made from a bad manga, people think it's good because it stays faithful, but I don't like it. If you did, that's fine, but you have to remember that the philosophy is weak, the characters don't develop, and the ending is predictable.\n",
      "Let me start by saying this: This review is only helpful if you haven't seen the first FMA. Shocking, I know, but people like this do exist.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alright, I've seen 12 episodes of FMA Brotherhood.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) The animation is stellar, the action is gorgeous, and scene arrangement ensure a smooth, liquid pacing that ensures you're never bored.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) The music, the voice actors, everything is great. I can't review sound - go watch and listen!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) The characters are fantastic.  The only character I hate is Ed, shockingly enough.  I know, how can you enjoy a series and hate the main character? As far as I can\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "tell, Ed is the male equivalent of a Tsundere, meaning as they develop how he actually thinks and feels, I'll grow to love him.  I hope.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The other characters, and there are a lot of them, carry the show.  Someone is constantly looking to have something done or has some agenda, and characters with conflicting agendas manifest naturally.  This makes for a gorgeous multi-linked plot that is getting both hectic but staying steady and clear.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4) Story: FMA Brotherhood is a show about two brothers making a mistake and then trying to fix it.  At least, on the surface.  It becomes rapidly clear a whole lot of other things are going on, and these things will doubtless lead our intrepid heroes down down down the rabbit hole until we find ourselves at the heart of some crazy hair brained world reaching plot.  Or at least, that is my anticipation.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The brotherhood dynamic, as cited in the title, actually doesn't seem like the critical plot focus to me thus far.  It plays an integral role, and parts along the way are definitely fleshing it out, but the real enjoyment from the series lies in the varied assortment of individuals you are meeting along the way.  I've read some of the other reviews, and they state these characters aren't being fleshed out enough.  Given the fact that the series hasn't ended yet, I'm desperately hoping this is true!  Good story telling is done by slowly shaving down to the core of what characters are.  Imagine my surprise in Ep. 11 to discover Roy Mustang isn't secretly a bad guy, in spite of how he is originally portrayed, and how I originally perceived him to be.  At this critical moment for him, my feelings about him completely toggled over to one where, hey, I know exactly who this guy is, and I like him a lot more for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5) Enjoyment: The show makes me lose sleep waiting for it to come out to view.  That should indicate just how much I love it so far.  I will say this: As long as they keep the quick pace up and keep chipping away at the truth, Brotherhood will become a stellar classic, making people wonder why there was any doubt as to where it was going.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I compare its pacing, and plot advancement solely to Code Geass for how quick and consistent it runs.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "***I've just now obtained FMA (the original) and started to watch it, struggled through about 12 episodes, and threw in the towel. It was boring, Brotherhood has spoiled me.  I hope this doesn't offend original viewers, but all that other stuff in there is fluff to what Brotherhood is portraying as plot critical, and since my mind is full of Brotherhood thoughts, well...\n",
      "When the original Fullmetal Alchemist series released, it was praised as one of the greatest anime ever. This series wasn't created to replace that position, but as more people read the continuing manga version of the story, more people likely wished for an animated series featuring that original plot. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood seems to be that original story, yet I couldn't confirm it myself as I haven't read the manga and only watched the original series. Many people claim it a strong point that this is the original author's intended direction of the plot, and that may be true, but I would say this specific\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "adaptation of the manga is likely not a good representation of the manga's fame.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is now praised ahead of the original series and is treated as one of the best anime ever created. I would personally disagree with that point, but not to the extent of calling it bad. This version of Fullmetal Alchemist stands out as one of the most complex shounen tales I have ever witnessed, while still carrying many of the shounen cliches. It has a big budget behind it, despite holding a smaller viewer base on its televised premiere than the original, and that budget shows.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From mentioning budget, I'd first like to cover the audio and visuals of Brotherhood. The visuals are some of the best I've seen and you can really tell it was made by Bones. The show is overflowing with visual attentions to detail that stick between scene transitions, and you will very rarely notice something missing. There are a variety of locations with great levels of detail in their backgrounds, and the animation is always there to serve motion. Despite some of the animation being a bit wonky, the show holds a good amount of great action.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack leaves a bit more to be desired. While the tracks that do exist are very unique, there isn't enough variety in the tracks available to correctly display every emotion a story like Fullmetal Alchemist needs to convey. The original series had plenty of action-oriented tunes to play, but this version seems to only have about three available and you'll hear them in just about every fight. In a shounen, action-adventure you'd expect more of a priority in that type of soundtrack instead of quieter, less-memorable ones. The soundtrack isn't as orchestrated as the original, and the music sounds very electronic at times, but the soundtrack isn't bad in its own right.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a final note towards budget: The openings/endings of this show are generally above-average, but none really express a feeling of excitement or anticipation and are usually softer, not really catching the feeling of the series. The last ending song was the most memorable by the simple notion that it fit better with what was actually going on in the series at the time. Mentioning timing, it should also be noted that there is quite a lot of odd placements and cut-offs of music in Brotherhood, and there are close to a dozen times when it will even conflict with the emotions you should be having in the story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond budget, the \"true\" story of Fullmetal Alchemist is a long and imaginative one. With the length of the manga, I could safely assume that Brotherhood doesn't cover a large percentage of the manga's details. This is where things start to stumble from the potential this series had. In the original series of Fullmetal Alchemist, there was a variety of unconnected problems and issues to deal with that kept things interesting. In Brotherhood, however, the show puts all of its focus onto one, single plot-goal, barely ever straying from that goal. Making a series of over sixty episodes needs some variety or twists to keep things interesting, but Brotherhood severely lacks in that aspect.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first dozen episodes start with an almost episodic nature, speeding through content that correlates with the original series. That could be justified by this being a supplement to the original series, but that only makes Brotherhood less sturdy on its own feet in the process. The show strikes a point shortly where an interesting plot begins. Even at that point the entire outcome of that plot is very predictable, but it serves some intrigue through the encounters it creates. However, it soon begins to drag as characters begin to do less and plan more of how to get from point A to point B in order to head to their predictable destination. There are no twists in this time to bring another rise in interest and the show assumes that one plot is enough. What the original series did to combat that is take what is treated as a secondary plot in Brotherhood (the regaining of Ed and Al's bodies, which is learned at the beginning) and put more focus on it, bringing out more detail and development. Brotherhood even pushes that to the side and fuels itself off of character interaction between a growing list of non-developed characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood had two chances to fix this problem with the direction they chose to go. One solution could have been to make the series longer and make more side-plots and more development in other characters to make the viewers care more for them. That would also fix the huge pacing issue that can be seen in the beginning, and throughout most of the show. The second route they could've taken, still focusing on this one plot, is shortening the entire show to about half its length and cutting out unnecessary details.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instead, Brotherhood focuses on the technicalities of fixing a large, yet predictable, situation. Choosing that path could still bring some interest if the dialogue was top-notch, but it just isn't at that level in Brotherhood. The planning the characters do to solve obstacles in their path is generally interesting and somewhat smart with the fantasy elements it has in place, but the terminology most of the characters use (in the english dub at least) is generally simple and very particular. You'll be hearing a lot of simple and repeated phrases for describing situations, and that is a large amount of the dialogue. Character interactions don't delve too much within the pasts and minds of each character, and development is barely made. Even the main characters, Ed and Al, almost feel like side characters after the first dozen of rushed episodes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we have a problem with pacing, a lack of focus towards variety in story and plot, a lack of soundtrack elements to correctly display moods, and I may even say a lack of style. The presentation of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood feels more in tune to getting to the point and rushing the way there. It never takes the time to introduce the viewer to the story and practically acts like a slideshow of what happens here and thereafter. There's barely any clever camera angles or attentions to detail in a consistent and unique style like the original, but there are plenty of details in the technicalities of the leading plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have a great feeling that the story of the manga had great potential of creating one of the best animated series around, but this attempt just falls short on direction. While the technical aspects of the manga's main plot are likely in place, it seems the director and screenwriter forgot to take into account that they are translating the story to film, not treating the film as the manga. A manga and a show are two different things that have different opportunities to be unique. Although the director of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was involved in the creation of the acclaimed movie \"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", there's a reason that he worked solely on the storyboards.\n",
      "Regardless of what's going on this time around, after episode one I am convinced that this FMA is definitely worth the watch. The story seems to take place sometime before the first FMA, but it's really hard to tell.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From what I've gathered it's sticking really closely to the manga this time around. As for the overall awesomeness of the animation, its seriously a 10. The action and the fighting are great and the animation is smooth and amazing. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's interesting to see the voice of Urahara as Roy Mustang (one of my fav Bleach characters is ROY?! lol) and Ed and Alphonse are the same\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "as last time. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "So yeah, based on only seeing the first episode its definitely a must watch in my opinion, but this is coming from a hardcore fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist. ENJOY!\n",
      "I know that writing a review after only seeing 10 episodes isn't really fair. But I just thought I'd share my opinion on it. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "After watching and entirely loving Fullmetal Alchemist I decided to watch Brotherhood. The very first scene was entirely different, and this continued throughout the rest of the episodes that I watched. After coming from FMA, the change in character behaviour and attitude was a complete shock. I couldn't bring myself to watch the rest of the series out of fear of ruining FMA completely.\n",
      "Fascinating. When Bones announced Brotherhood, I was like ‘You want to sell us the same story again, huh? That’s really greedy, you bastards!’ Well, I still think that Bones did it for money. Of course they did, because that is how industry works. But after spending about half a year of my life on watching Brotherhood, I have to admit that this show is worth every single yen it will earn.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood is a ridiculous phenomenon to me. It subverted all my criteria for choosing anime to watch. I always preferred ranobe-based shows to manga-based, and I never liked long-runners. Y’see, my ideal was some 13-episode\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "bittersweet anime based on a sci-fi novel with some cute girls or something. That doesn’t resemble Brotherhood at all, right? But I cannot find a single clue to not liking the new Fullmetal Alchemist series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood’s plot is nearly flawless. (I still have some questions, but I always have them, so screw me.) The first anime was good, but it played out somewhere in the middle, when its plot overran the manga. There is no such problem in the second anime. Even more, its plot goes epic near the end. Well, the word ‘epic’ is not even enough here. If English had a single word for ‘oh god, so epically epic’, that would be a better choice. And plus the skilful character development… Elric brothers actually grew up throughout the series. And there are a lot more characters with their own individualities, y’know. Arakawa Hiromu-shi is damn genius in this field, no kidding. Call me a sexist, but I never thought that female mangaka can create a plot so twisted, exciting and based on pure logic. Like, remember that episode when… Oh, I can’t bring examples without spoiling something. Bad, but let’s better proceed to next aspect.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Only objective issue I can bring here is that the beginning was a bit fast, but that’s okay since Bones already covered that part of the story in the first show. However, if you didn’t watch that, you’ll find that first episodes of Brotherhood are somewhat rushed.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another amazing thing here is that Bones managed to keep animation quality on a high level for the whole duration of Brotherhood. They really approached this show with all responsibility. That’s praiseworthy, right?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the last aspect is music. The first anime was notable for its catchy opening and ending themes, and Brotherhood continued its tradition. Alchemist has one of the best soundtracks in anime, I think.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh god, I already ran out of themes to discuss. Without anything to criticize, I always have a vocabulary shortage. So, the summary: Brotherhood is a great anime. It easily overwhelms the first one in terms of enjoyment. Hell, it may be the best shōnen show about the guys with superpowers that was ever made. Some people can dislike Brotherhood for its popularity or annoying fans, but every good series receive this kind of treatment. Y’know, fandom is fandom and anime is anime. It’s a bad thing to mix those up.\n",

The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it.  Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it.  It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe.  The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly to\n",

The story was always keeping the 'watcher' wanting to keep watching no matter what.( I found myself staying up way later than I planned to keep watching this series) Every concept in this anime (Alchemy and Alkahestry) was simply fantastic learning about and watching it be used from creating giant flipping fists punching people in battle to saving peoples lives. Anyone who has watched this anime(or read the manga) probably agrees with me that they would give anything for our world to have Alchemy. And also,THERE ARE NO FILLERS, *laughs like\n",

Watching the magnificent view of the Resembool country side to every small detail of the tediously created alchemy circles to every fight scene; the breathtaking and epic animations were clearly shown in every episode. All the fights had more... oomph, than those in FMA. There was more fight and felt like you were actually there. They were more dramatic and more gruesome(gruesome being a good thing)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sound in FMA Brotherhood was fantastic as well. All the ending and beginning songs were spectacular.(as well as their animations) Much effort was put into every sound. The sound of a transmutation circle going off, the clapping of hands for Ed's alchemy, agonizing screams of people who loose limbs or are mortally wounded, well thought out speech for every character; they were all fantastic.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Characters were spectacular as well as everything else. Every Character was fabulous and played an important role for the overall story. The only problem I had involving characters was that the main antagonist's personality was boring. He didn't seem interesting enough. Another minor problem with one of the characters, I would have given anything for Sloth to say, \"What a drag.\" instead of, \"What a pain\" (if anyone got that reference)(hm, that may be considered copyright, I don't know)\n",

The great amount of suspension and action leading up to the Promise Day and how burly men.(in Brotherhood it's Major Armstrong and Sig Curtis, forgot who it is in FMA) There was I was literally crying from how funny it was, how they compete against each other with muscles and gain each others respect. Then see them handshake. One of my most favorite things about this anime. \n",

I don't know what I was thinking.\n",

FMA brotherhood has a pretty damn good ending(better than most), well I mean sure it could have gone on for another episode or two to explain some things *cough* *cough* Winry and that stuff. Anyways, if you watched FMA and wondering if you should watch Brotherhood, WATCH IT. If you've already watched both of them, I hope you agree with me that Brotherhood is superior, watch it again because it never gets old.\n",
      "This is one of the greatest anime's I have ever seen in my life. After watching this show more then three times it is truly perfect. Characters and character development is amazing. The story line has you thinking is one of the most original stories I have ever seen. The sound and openings are great. The art style fits the anime perfectly and it brings out the personality of the characters. Overall this is truly the greatest anime.\n",

I prefer it over the first anime, but I did watch Brotherhood first which may bias that, though the ending of Brotherhood is definitely better and I really enjoy many of the characters that the first anime excluded.\n",

      "in some way, even if you don't know it will at first. The story follows the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, on their journey to find a philosopher's stone so that they can get back Al's body and Ed's arm and leg which they lost several year ago when they tried to bring their deceased moher back to life with alchemy but failed. Ed becomes a state alchemist with title Fullmetal Alchemist which he uses to help his research as he and Alphonse travel around the country searching for leads. Along the way, they meet Homunculi (seeingly immortal beings named after the 7 deadly sins who are te main antagonists of the series), Scar (a man who seeks revenge on state alchemists for starting a war against his people and killing them), and friends like Ling (a prince from another country seeking imortality), and other state alchemists and officials who help him like Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\n",

      "The art in FMAB is exceptional and just as good in the beginning as it is in he end. The fight scenes are well designed and show an amazing amount of detail. The one thing to note is that this show has a large amount of blood (especially in the fights with the homunculi who can survive even if their bodies are cut in half many times). The sound goes along very well with tracks that fit the mood perfectly (my personal favorie being \"Pride's Theme,\" a very creepy song that fits Pride [a homunculus] very well).\n",

      "The characters in FMAB are some of the best. Edward Elric is my favorite anime character. Ed is a short, blonde boy who los his right arm and left leg which are now replaced with automail. He is the youngest state alchemist ever due to his abilit to transmute (the act of doing alchemy) without a transmuation circle (which he gained at the same timehe lost his arm an leg). Alphonse is Ed's younger brother whose soul resides in a large suit of armor which was the result of Ed's last-ditch effort to save his brother after failing t bring their mother back to life. Al is often mistaken for the Fullmetal Alchemist due to this which annoys Ed (plus Al's now taller than his shorter, older, brother). Winry Rockbell is Ed and Al's childhood friend and Ed's automail mechanic who created his leg and arm.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some of my other favorite characters are Envy (one of the homunculi who can shapeshift and disguise himself [his gender is never actually determined] which basially makes him the troll of this show), Roy Mustang (the Flame Alchemist who wants to become the military leader of the country in place of King Bradley one day and works with Ed and Al at times though Ed doesn't really like him much at first), Riz Hawkeye (the kin of woman who obliterates any stereoptypes about women, she is Mustang's most trustworthy soldier and helps protect him her badass-ness), Ling Yao (the prince from another country who seeks immortality, though saying much abou him would be a spoiler; accompanying Ling are Lan Fan and Fu who are his personal bodyguards and will lay their lives down to protect him [Lan Fan follows in Riza's badass, stereotype-destroying footsteps]), and Maes Hughes (a militaryman who loves his family, his friends, his family, being cheerful, and of course his faily [want to see a picture of his daughter?]).\n",

      "I enjoyed every second of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The ending is one of the best ever, the characters are some of the best ever, the story has many plot twists but none that seem forced and the lack of filler keeps the story moving at all times making you want more and bringing you back for each episode. I really can't any fault with show.\n",

      "That said I think the ending of Brotherhood was all around put together 5x as well. In all the anime was pretty good and was pretty interesting, but I don't get why it averages such high ratings. I prefer the sad ending of the first one, but the story had already fallen apart by that point. Brotherhood on the other hand knew exactly where it was going and attempted to get there at 10x the speed of the first one and with 1/3rd the character\n",

      "Believability: I would prefer Brotherhood's composition with the first one's story. I just didn't find it that believable. What can make a break a story's believability is the action scenes. Every single antagonist that they fought in Brotherhood should have won. The only fights that could conceivably end in a win were ones with Scar and the only reason I think that is because Scar is a bamf. The biggest hit to the believability of the story was everything to do with the main antagonist. Everything about him including how he lost is hard for me to believe and made it impossible for me to immerse myself in the story. If you care less about how believable the means are and care more about the results, then Brotherhood is great for you.\n",

There are no huge weaknesses to the other homunculi abilities and yet his is made inferior just by that fact of him being a homunculus? When I think about him I remember how Ed beat him in the first one. His armor had no real weakness, Ed just used his brain and made the armor not armor.\n",

      "-For those who have seen the anime and wonder what I found unbelievable about Father I have provided a few things below:\n",

      "Alchemy: How did Father not know about the foreign versions of Alchemy. He was made of the stuff in the first place. That simply makes no sense.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His Death: Talk about cliche... Ed fit into every single male protagonist cliche when he fought Father. Somehow a guy who can do above average Alchemy can beat a being made from the stuff, who can use alchemy with a thought? What!? One might make the argument that Father was out of energy during their fight. Well... isn't that convenient. He could have squashed them at any other time, but didn't because he correctly assumed they were nowhere close to his strength. It is the classic villain loses because of his own arrogance instead of any real actions taken by the heroes. It just seemed like the story could have simply been about Father and how he tried to become God and failed because it wasn't possible and have no mention of any of the main characters except to have them kick start his ritual.\n",
      "This anime is about two brothers fighting to regain their bodies after a alchemy experiment gone wrong. Along the way they uncover an evil plot and pick up many companions. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Plot: Think of a very linear anime like Fist of the North Star, where Kenshiro travels from village to village, challenge to challenge, always moving forward, always exploding heads and never revisiting any of the places he’s conquered. FMA is the opposite. It actually reminded me of an RPG videogame the way the characters would travel back and forth between cities and how these locations would change between visits. For example, Edward goes from the\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "Central city to the East, back to central to deal with new shit, visits Winry in his village, goes to central again to deal with new shit before heading to another city in the far East to deal with even more shit etc… I love this because it makes understanding the geography of Amestris important and allows the viewer to explore the country with Ed/Al.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pacing: The series starts out doing a great job showing how characters get from point A to point B but then they get lazy. About halfway through the series characters start jumping between cities without proper explanation of how they got there. For some people it’s irrelevant but to me, it gives the impression that the characters simply teleported. I mean how does a little girl magically get from the frozen tundra of the north of the country’s eastern desert in between episodes? I’d like to know. Now do I want them to devote ½ of the series’ screen time to train rides? No. But it could have used smoother transitions.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also, By season 3 the cast gets large enough to where the episodes switch between 4-5 different character groups in different parts of the country. In theory this is good because it adds intricacy to the plot. The problem I have with FMA is that they will leave one storyline on a cliffhanger to switch to a relatively uneventful storyline. For example, they’ll leave Edward bleeding and half dead in a frozen wasteland just to switch to Al and Winry helping villagers build houses. It’s one thing if you follow Game of Throne’s style of switching from cliffhanger to cliffhanger but in this case I thought they could have cut out some of the fluff to make the story arc pacing a little smoother.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Action: I always like it when anime introduces a new fighting style. FMA does this with the addition of alchemy. The fight scenes are cool, creative and diverse. I also liked how even though Ed was a badass his friends didn't become useless or obsolete (aka like Goku's friends).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Comedy: This deserves its own section. Basically it’s pretty simple, if you like anime-style, slapstick, comedic moments you’re going to jizz yourself every almost episode if you don’t, you won’t stop rolling your eyes. There’s probably a Japanese term for it but it’s the comedy that involves fainting/nose bleeds after embarrassing moments, extreme facial distortions when angry, sleeping snot bubbles, huge skull blisters appearing after a friendly wrench beating. I found it a little much to be honest and it gave the anime a much lighter tone. Some people will love it though.\n",

      "Art: Good \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters: Great memorable characters with very vibrant personalities. I thought the concept of the homunculi was brilliant and their personalities, despite embodying single sins, were very complex and interesting—especially Greed, Wrath and Envy. Oh and Scar is one of the most badass antiheroes in anime. My only complaint is that they spent a LOT of time developing smaller side characters and not a lot of time killing them off. I mean yeah it’s good to develop support characters but by the end of the series the cast felt a little clunky. I mentioned this earlier but even in a 64 episode series you only have so much screen time. Instead of devoting time to exploring the thoughts, struggles and emotions of minor henchmen and tagalongs, why not spend it on the mains who are so much more interesting? Using the law of equivalent exchange, I would have liked FMA to transmute some side characters into more screen time for underdeveloped plots like Winry-Ed, backstories of Homunculi, Scar’s story, Father, etc. \r\n",
      "Overall: I am 90% satisfied. I think I would have been at 100% if this series could have been a little shorter or a lot longer. Basically if they had trimmed it down or spent the extra time to make everything complete. Everyone always raves about the ending but to be honest I still wanted more.\r\n",
      "Blood/Gore: It’s surprisingly bloody for a MA14+ anime. Severed limbs, bullet wounds, human sacrifice…mixed in with slapstick comedy.\r\n",
      "Love/Romance: Yes, there is a romantic subplot that develops very, very slowly over the series but it’s not the main focus. The “Action/Romance” genre is often attempted but seldom done well. It usually turns out to be an action anime w/ a clumsy love-interest side-plot or a sappy romance story with 2nd rate action. Either way the non-dominant side just becomes a plot device for the other one. Personally, I’m not really into sappy romance animes but I like it when a romantic subplot is done right and can make me care about a couple’s mutual survival in the context of a larger struggle (Mirai Nikki, Gosick). Anyway FMA does that well but I thought it could have been done better. \r\n",

Being the somewhat impatient person I am, I went online searching for the next episode one night after the tenth or eleventh episode had finished.

I decided to read it, to see if there was a huge difference between the manga and the anime. I cheated a little bit and started off a bit into the story and discovered that lots of stuff was there that was not in the anime. So, I had to treck back to a point where this information started. I finished the manga in a couple days and WOOOW. Not only was I correct about there being some information missing in the anime, but there was so so so so so much more that was supposed to happen.\n",

      "                  ...\n",
      "original. If you’re reading this review, you likely know that the original show deviated from the manga after a short while, and continued in a rather different direction. As manga tends so often to be, the story of the manga ends up being much stronger than what the creators of the original anime were able to come up with. “Brotherhood” follows the story of the manga quite closely, thus the anime never feels like filler, or just boring junk.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first fifteen episodes or so are very similar to about the first half of the original “Fullmetal Alchemist”. “Brotherhood” covers more story in less time, and doesn’t drag nearly like the original did. This is especially apparent in the beginning, where some parts that were already told in the original series were more or less skipped over to save time. Purists might squawk about this, but it was probably a wise idea, in light of time constraints.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you’ve seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist, then you’ll be familiar with the first major portions of the show. It may feel like a rehash for the first several episodes, but you’ll fairly quickly realize that the scale of what will eventually take place is much greater, and much more sinister than what the original Fullmetal Alchemist conveyed. The twists that Ed and Al are taken through are enough to leave you wanting more after each episode. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But enough rambling. If you’d like a synopsis, just look one up.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Art 10/10) – The art in this show is simply superb! Characters and scenery are drawn with careful detail, and they also achieve a sense of realism, which is somewhat necessary in a “Steam-Punk” world that could almost be America a century ago. The mix of realism, combined with the fantasy of Alchemy, creates for an interesting balance that not many animes can achieve. Additionally, the art is very smooth, with each movement flowing into the next seamlessly. There were a few instances where larger or more intricate drawings were done with computer animation. These scenes are slightly choppier than the rest of the anime, but you likely won’t notice unless you’re looking for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only gripe I had with the animation was early on in the show, where characters would burst into silly caricatures  when they were especially emotional about something. Most notably is Ed transforming to look like a praying mantis when someone calls him short. This made it seem like the show didn’t take itself very seriously at first, but such incidents gradually declined as the show progressed, and became rather scarce during the more serious parts of the show. I simply think the show would have benefitted from less outbursts of this nature early on. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Sound 9/10) – The voice acting in this show is some of the best you’ll hear. I was pleasantly relieved to hear that there were no annoying, shrill voices that anime can be guilty of at times. There weren’t any standout performances that I can think of, but each actor voiced their role marvelously.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that it sounded to me like some of the music had been recycled from the original Fullmetal Alchemist. The music fit the scenes very well, but I thought an update might have been helpful. Also, the music never really stuck out to me as being particularly awesome. It was good, but not quite deserving of a 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Characters 10/10) – It will be quite a struggle to keep my comments succinct on this topic! “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” shines brilliantly in this area! Never before have I grown so attached to such a diverse cast of characters. There were a number of characters that I wasn’t particularly attached to in the original series that I grew to love in “Brotherhood”.  The show does a brilliant job of making each character’s motivations easy to understand, yet complex enough that they aren’t totally flat.  It also has a way of forcing characters who were once enemies to work together when faced with a common enemy. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was especially impressed by how Ed and Al were so much easier to relate to in “Brotherhood”. I found myself much more emotionally attached to them, and had a much stronger desire to see them succeed. Al is much stronger and helps Ed fight much more often, which I also found to be a pleasant change of pace. I could name probably ten other characters who I grew attached to, yet wasn’t terribly fond of in the original series. “Brotherhood” also introduces a set of new characters that blend in perfectly with that cast that I was already familiar with. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The long and short of it is this: the cast of “Brotherhood” will draw you in and leave you eagerly watching their every move until the conclusion of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Enjoyment 10/10) – I really don’t have much to say on this topic, except I loved it! I never had to force myself to keep going, and I enjoyed every bit of the show!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Overall 10/10) – Definitely give this one a shot! It’s well worth your time. And in my opinion, it’s far superior to its  predecessor.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood is a straight up mediocre show. I came into this anime so excited. I would always hear people say \"its a masterpiece\" or \"its the best anime of all time.\" Its even the highest rated anime on mal. I was hyped up and ready to see what the show had to offer. However, I was immensely disappointed. This show is so overrated it is unbelievable. It is so corny and ridiculous I am convinced only children enjoy this show. During \"serious\" fight scenes there are always bursts of unfunny comedy that is just straight up cringey. There is no sense of suspense\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "or nothing that keeps you engaged in the story. The characters are lame (especially that annoying crybaby talking robot boy), the music is meh, the animation is decent for its time. But I mean wow this show is so corny and is obviously targeted towards little kids. Corny does not mean bad tho. However this anime tries to be serious and corny at the same time which just completely ruins the shows atmosphere. This is by no means a masterpiece and should not even be in the top 50. Attack on titan is 10 times better I cannot believe the amount of people that overrate this kids show.\n",
      "This review will be rather short.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is not bad in general, it is just awfully directed. The main reason which caused that I didn't enjoy this anime was pathetic humour which is ruining EVERY episode. For example, there is a situation where main characters are talking about something interesting, and unexpectedly something \"funny\" happens and main thread of their conversation (or even whole episode) is cutted, because \"funny\" situation is most important of course. It is happening in EVERY episode, sometimes few times. Yeah, that 'humour' destroyed the whole story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this is not the only reason of course. The next thing: main characters. They\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "are boring. Typical battle shounen scheme. There were a lot episodically characters which were much better and interesting than Erlic brothers and no.1 badass - Bradley King.\r\n",
      "I liked the whole idea of philosopher stones and homunculus thing (and their names taken from seven deadly sins)\r\n",
      "The plot story is way too episodic too.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art - I loved that backgrounds. Seriously, it was really well drawn. Animation was nice too. But in other side, almost all characters looked very bad and too simple.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound - voice actors were matched really good (as usual in anime). Of course I'm talking about original Japanese voices. Soundtrack is average, I don't like this type of soundtracks (symphonic ones, like from 'Murican blockbuster). It is boring as hell, I'm glad, that it is rather not usual in anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Summarizing,I felt like I was watching rather a generic USA movie (trust me, I've seen plenty of them in my life, I started watching anime, because I was bored as hell by hollywood crap) than actual anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA:B is yet another battle shounen, which are thousands. It is not bad anime, but in my opinin it doesn't deserve to be even in top 50. It would be much better, when it would be 50% shorter and without ALL that pathetic humour.\r\n",
      "I watched it, and probably in next year I will totally forget about it.\n",
      "Well i know about half the world right now is about to curse at me for writing this, but I don't care. . Now for my Take on the so called \"greatest anime of all time\". IMO its pretty damn mediocre. I had watched the original, and thought it ok. Now i had to watch this. Due to my personal dislike of filler i thought id like FMABH. Yet i was sorely disappointed. I tried to go in open minded hoping to enjoy. Yet, found myself bored, I mean very bored. Like watching Bakemonogatari bored. Nothing to me stands out in this show. One it\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "has my least favorite character of all time in it(ok possible there are othr worse characters). Yet people treat Elric as if he was the greatest character. Hes a very very bad character for the number of episodes(more anger from everyone). Let me ask you, why is he fighting? Hes, fighting  to get him and his brother's body back. Its not as if their was some injustice, someone who stole their body. Oh no it was their own foolishness and i didn't feel sorry. Hell i didn't feel sorry during the entire series, Huges dies? who gives a !@#$. it wasn't sad. he went down swinging and he had a family, but rly? Its not like Clannad, (i hate harems but this is sad) and possibly even grave of the fireflies. Those are  sad. Now what ill say it does right sometimes is animation. even though at first i loved the alchemy mechanics,(so cool) it got very repetitive. The fights were smooth, but them, like most of the series became repetitive and i fast forwarded through to get to some plot. Let me now say though some things are great the first op was so good and it got my hopes up. the art was beautiful, and some characters were actually good. such as Hoenhiem or Rath.  Sound such as swords were amazing a true shinning point. Yet in the end what rly killed me was the predictable ending. I was expecting an epic final fight or epic final plot tiwst true Stiens;Gate or Madoka style, yet it was just final bad guy standing there, and guys saying \"FIRE EVERYTHING\". Then bad guy just takes it like a bauws. I did like that he was in it for Knowledge, at least he had a viable reason unlike elric who just lost and arm and a leg,but with automail why even give a !@#$? FMABH to me this is the greatest overrated anime of our time. The people who have this a favorite should rly try to expand out a little, and if it is your fav. well im sorry my opinion greatly differs. To me FMBA is just \"good\" no where does it excel to me, and im glad im over with it. (excuse me while i watch something good like Mushishi or Gintama)\n",
      "There is not much more to say about this other than that it is THE masterpiece. This anime is perfect in all ways. The variety of characters and personalities developed throughout the characters are what put this show on the top. The light-hearted humorous scenes were well balanced with dark, vicious scenes to create an anime that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire anime. The plot behind the anime is superb along with the detailed fight scenes and lessons that characters learned as a result. Not to mention this anime also has a killer soundtrack and animation to go along with it.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "The only bad thing about the anime is that all other anime you watch after this will not even compare...\n",

      "WRONG.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The new season itself (from the sole episode I've watched so far) can be completely separated from the much loved first season. The director basically clicked the restart button on the series and we are in for a new rollercoaster of madness. This season is rumored to be working closer to the mangas storyline so no confusing other world as we witnessed in the rather -interesting- FMA movie. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation is very fluid and the art is also more true to Hiromu\n",
      "                  ...\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second adaptation of the full metal alchemist manga. The show presents two brothers embarking a journey with a simple goal of recovering their limbs/body. In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, a practice called alchemy is used to obtain something in exchange for something of equal value. Alchemy is very versatile in this sense as it used healing, fixing and even fighting. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fullmetal alchemist presents a very interesting and enjoyable unique story with each episode building up on one another. It is well paced and consistent with its overall goal. No episodes felt irrelevant to the plot which made every episode\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "worth watching. Its build up with each episode created a very satisfying ending with great twists and turns. It was unpredictable at times and had great action with the use of alchemy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters in Fullmetal Alchemist are very likeable with each character having an ulterior motive. The interactions with the cast provided great entertainment and depth. Character development of the cast was top notch with lots of memorable moments. There are many antagonists in the show with each being labelled as one of the deadly sins. Each one managed to live up to their name having different personalities and motives. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I was completely satisfied after watching Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood. It provided a great coherent story with characters that were very memorable. It receives a high re-watch value and recommendation.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood surpasses the original series in almost every aspect imaginable. After I had finished watching the original FMA, I felt a endless sense of dissatisfaction, as the ending didn't sit right with me at all. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'll be honest, i put off watching Brotherhood for a very long time, as i didn't think that a lot of the series would have changed dramatically. I expected a bit of enhanced animation and the addition of a few characters. God. I couldn't be more wrong. The remake shines a new light onto the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, improving all of the imperfections and errors that were in\n",

      "the original series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story line was healthy and straight to the point right from episode 1. No mucking about. As the plot goes on it gets hard to compare both series as the plot slowly drifts in difference directions from each other. What i was most enjoyed about was of-course, the ending. It was initiated perfectly, leaving no questions un-answered, which i feel was my main issue with Fullmetal Alchemist. It tied the entire show together neatly, the way it should have been.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation was beautiful. At times it was inconsistent, but even then it was great. Given that there is roughly a 6 year gap between the FMA and brotherhood, improved animation was a defiant. A lot more detail was provided though, which was a pleasant surprise.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ah, now for the sound. Masafumi Mima deserves a medal, because he completely nailed this. I don't think there was a single OP or ED that i didn't enjoy. It matched the concept of Fullmetal Alchemist and scenes so well. There is nothing to say other than it was amazing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters were developed a lot which was nice to see. It seemed there were at least a few episodes per main character to try to get to know them and deconstruct them as a character. This was a smart way to build the connection between viewer and character. Also bringing in a few new main characters that were not even mentioned in the original series was risky, but boy, it pull off. It gave a whole new feel to the show. With that being said, that squinty eyed guy sure knew how to annoy me at times.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall I am so glad i finally decided to watch Brotherhood. I ask for nothing else. I am more then content now hah. For everyone that has seen Fullmetal Alchemist and is thinking about watching Brotherhood but is worried it will be a waste of time because you think you already know what will happen. Go watch it, now. Stop reading this review and go watch it.\n",
      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good show but to me it isn't as good as the original FMA.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main reason for this statement is the 'changes' in the story. I know this series supposedly follows the manga but that's probably my problem. I've seen some shonen anime and the plot usually isn't the best thing about it, especially the ending. I liked the mysteries and the logic in the first FMA better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't watch all the episodes in one go because I thought the first 14 episodes were really bad. Up untill those episodes the story is the same as the original and they probably\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "rushed through it. Wasn't that part of the story 30 episodes long in FMA?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My third remark is the animation. I don't exactly know what's different ( I think they didn't use as many shadows) but the art seems worse, less dark which probably fits the shonen story better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can understand why a lot of people like this version of FMA better, it's probably because of the same reason why shonen anime are among the most popular, but I think some of the tragedy and consequences of equal trade that were present in the original FMA were lost in this series.\n",
      "I love watching Anime since my Childhood and this one is my list of my TOP ANIME that i've ever watched. The Story is very unique that i can never expected the Scenes, What i love is their Sacrifices of the Characters not only the Protagonist but the Extra and even some of Antagonist here, The Enjoyment and Fun i experience here is unforgetable, I remember when i watch this Series ALONE while holding a Snacks. (This is what i'm doing everytime i watch Anime.)  I'm not expert in Animation but i think it is good. Thank you.\n",
      "This is my all-time favourite anime, and most likely will forever stay that way. The protagonist Edward Elric is my all-time favourite anime character, he has such a deeply tragic backstory alongside his brother Alphonse, which got me really invested in him right away, he grows and and develops so much as a character throughout the course of the show, has such an entertaining and funny personality which doesn't make him look bland at any point, shares such incredibly strong character dynamics which several other important characters in the show the suffering and pain he endures throughout which makes his final happy and fulfilled ending\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "incredibly satisfactory narrative wise. The show as a whole has such an amazingly compact storytelling, such a grand cast consisting of a wide range of wonderfully written characters in terms of characterization, great world building which is evident by how plot thickens and thickens towards as the story reaches its end, resulting in an epic, memorable and satisfactory climax which gives a proper closure to the story and the characters. The show via the rule of \"Equivalent Exchange\" actually heavily explores the fundamentals of karmic justice, which makes everything that happens feel grounded in morality. No other show has made me so deeply feel and care for the characters even again, I can give this a 1000/10 if I could. :)\n",
      "I recently finished watching this after seeing it at the top of the charts and learning that it had been at the top for a while. I can't say I'm surprised at this. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, or FMA:B, exceeded the expectations that I had for it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: 10/10\r\n",
      "This is probably the thing that FMA:B does the best. The plot is engaging, and progresses at a reasonable pace. I have seen many people saying that this anime does not do a good job adapting the beginning of the manga with the first 14 or so episodes, but as a person who has not read the manga, I\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "think that the first 14 episodes are still very good. They are completely outshined by the remaining 50 episodes, but nonetheless still enjoyable. When it comes to the pacing, I also appreciate that this anime focuses more on the plot than on the fights, like how many other popular shounen like Naruto do. When the pace of the fights gets to Naruto levels, despite how good the story may be, it can feel unbearable to me at times to keep watching. The plot twists are reveals in Brotherhood are also executed quite impressively.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art: 8/10\r\n",
      "FMA:B's art/animation isn't bad, but it's not what brought it to the top of the charts either. In the first few episodes, it looked a little bit lackluster. I don't know if this is just because the technology in 2009 wasn't as good, they didn't work as hard here because they already did with the 2003 adaptation, or simply that I got used to it. Regardless, later on, the show's animation does look to generally improve, and when it tries to, it can look CLEAN, especially in some scenes when Roy Mustang goes ham. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound: 7/10\r\n",
      "I didn't pay conscious attention to FMA:B's sound effects, but I never thought anything sounded off while watching this. I watched and recommend the dub because it fits the setting better than Japanese speech. Seriously, these characters have the whitest names ever. Also, the Amestrian characters' writing is done in English. The cast of the dub voices do a fantastic job. The only minor complaint I have is that initially, Edward's English voice is a bit grating and can take a second to get used to. But in the comedic scenes, his voice is excellent. I love all of the OPs and EDs in this anime, But I do have to point out a flaw with the OST. First off, it's not outstanding like a Hiroyuki Sawano work. More importantly, some of the tracks just don't fit the setting. FMA:B takes place in what seems to be based on Europe in the early 20th century, but some of the soundtrack sounds like music from the medieval period. If I listened to some of this music without knowing what anime it's from, I'd assume it's from something like Seven Deadly Sins.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character: 10/10\r\n",
      "FMA:B has one of my favorite casts of characters, and in my opinion is only surpassed by one other anime that I have seen. There's not much for me to say here, but I liked every character and I had trouble picking a favorite. Edward is an amazing shounen protagonist, but my favorite character is Scar, who I think is criminally underrated. The Homunculi, especially Wrath, are fantastic villains.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment: 9/10\r\n",
      "The only issue I had that halted my enjoyment for a second was that in the middle of the story, all of the characters start going to and being in different places, and it can become difficult to remember who is where and why. But even without knowing the details at the moment, I still enjoy the hell out of FMA:B. These episodes could spend an opening minute or two on some recap, but the Internet and a quick Google search could take care of this problem anyway. Other than this, I have no gripes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall: 9/10\r\n",
      "Perfection doesn't exist, but FMA: Brotherhood does come pretty close. That doesn't mean it's the best anime, or even that it's my favorite. What I mean is that there is something in this that can be enjoyed by everyone. The plot is engaging, the characters are all likeable and/or relatable, there are fights but not enough to destroy the show's pacing, there is not too much violence or gore, there are cute ships and hints of romance, there are minimal amounts of fanservice if any, there is clean art/fluid animation, and there is good music. I strongly recommend watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood if you haven't already.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thanks for reading my first ever MAL review!\n",
      "Ehh...I loved the first Fullmetal Alchemist, but what I've seen so far of Brotherhood...sorry but I don't really like what they've done with the characters. The art style is...well, sort of like pokemon in my opinion and so not in a good way. I understand that some people might want the series to follow the manga a lot closer, but I thought it was fine the way it was in the original. I feel like they're doing more damage than good with this series.\n",
      "Jesus where do I begin,\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all, the story is NOT the incredible masterpiece everybody claims it is. The characters are shallow and filled with tropes and gags that are repeated CONSTANTLY. The art is ok I guess but none of the fight scenes that are promised in the openings actually seem to happen in the show itself, and besides the occasional flashy 5 seconds at the end of a fight there isn't much happening in the fight scenes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story feels incredibly rushed at times, which is strange considering that this was studio Bones' second attempt at this show. The sound is the best part\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "of the show honestly as the sound effects are perfect, the voice acting is stellar, and the op and end themes are all bangers.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall I'm giving this show a 1 because not only is it seriously overrated; but it's also just not very good at all.\n",
      "The art and action scenes are great. The writing is terrible and the \"expansion pack\" of characters (saying this having watched the 2003 anime) is annoying.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some side characters are too dramatic and have more story than they need to, well other more important characters lack story and depth. With really got me with the comparison between a certain character's death scene. In the first anime he's happening slow motion and there are flashbacks, and another character sees them again, and it's powerful how this character effected the other characters. It's beautiful. It's art. I cry everytime. In the second anime that character just dies. The\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a pretty beloved show on MAL and within the anime scene in general.  Personally, while I enjoyed it, I don't necessarily think it is the best thing since sliced bread.  It kept me entertained, and even at times made me feel an emotion or two, but the slow start and sometimes dragging plot didn't necessarily keep me thinking about watching the next episode when I was busy with other activities.  That being said, it is certainly worth a watch through at least once if you have the stomach for a 60+ episode series!  Let's get into the\n",

      "breakdown.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story (8/10) - I think the story was fairly well done.  It wasn't groundbreaking and it didn't necessarily have a lot of \"oh snap!\" moments, but it executed quite well.  Its exposition was usually laser focused on the characters and history that mattered, the plot was consistently moved forward to the inevitable conclusion, and you did get a sense of something grander going on.  It didn't waste your time with a ton of filler, and you could see this spiderweb of deception in every corner of the world.  The events were logical, believable, and often relateable despite being set in a fantastical world of magic, with problems often mirroring very real life scenarios.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It also handled flashbacks remarkably well I think.  Many shows just drag flashbacks on and on.  FMA:B kept them quick and relevant.  It actually made me enjoy them and made me curious about the backstory rather than beating me over the head with historical exposition to justify everything.  My only real complaint with the story was how it dragged at the beginning while it was setting up the spider-webbing for the over-arching grand scheme.  It took nearly 20 episodes to get going, but once it did get going, it took off at a brisk run.  It was a significant enough annoyance to me though that I can't give the story a 9 despite its pretty quality execution.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art (7/10) - The art was certainly above average, but it didn't really stand out in any particular way to me.  It was consistently solid, with no mistakes, but not beautiful.  It served its purpose and allowed you to immerse yourself in the world, but was short of being truly captivating.  There were definitely brief moments where it came close to being stunning though, and I have to give credit for the very eye-catching design of Pride (hah, I made a funny!).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound (5/10) - I think the sound for this show was its weakest quality.  It felt to me like it was merely adequate.  It served its purpose, but nothing really was memorable to me from the soundtrack to the voicing.  My personal taste may be heavily colouring my opinion here, but I really just found the sound as action-average as any J-Pop intro to a RomCom or Ecchi.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters (8/10) - Along with the story, the characters were quite well handled.  They were all very standard stereotypes, but each had their own unique quirks and motivations to keep them interesting.  I wouldn't say any were particularly deep, but there were certainly moments where I would feel for a couple characters.  I enjoyed learning about all their backstories, and I enjoyed that they all walked their own paths, or at least tried to until they were often drawn back together by fate.  Their independence was actually relateable instead of the usual excessive aloofness of \"independent\" characters in many other shows.  They genuinely felt like individuals rather than cogs in a big machine.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment (7/10) - At my first foray into this series, I honestly have to say I was pretty \"meh\" about it.  Up until about episode 18 for me, the story dragged along as it tried to set everything up and introduce all the main players.  It sagged under the weight of it and I often found myself thinking of other things I could be doing while watching.   It was still enjoyable... just not really compelling.  Starting out this was a 5/10 for me.  After episode 18 though, the show finally kicked it into gear and I found my enjoyment increased *measurably*.  Middle of the show it was a 6/10 and by the end it landed a 7.  It's worth watching if you can make it to the end, especially considering the pleasant and fulfilling ending that so many action anime lack these days.  If I was my younger self, I could see myself having enjoyed it even more.  I can't say I'll rewatch it, by I'm certainly glad I've seen it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So overall I give \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" a 7/10.  It was almost an 8, but not quite.  Not because it did anything wrong, but more that it didn't try to push itself at all and stayed in its comfort-zone.  The story was interesting enough though and the characters did often elicit some compassion from me.  If you're reading this to figure out if you should watch this show, then sure, you'll probably find something in it worth your time (as long as you are good with 60+ episodes), but be careful not to go into it with too much hype in mind.\n",
      "Man, I was really late to the party on this one. Every time I saw polls on the best anime shows released, this would be usually top 5, maybe top 3. I remember hearing people talking about this when I was still in school, the type of people who didn't like anime telling me \"yeah, it's pretty good\". After about 6 years of hearing about it, and doubting it, I finally gave it a shot. Holy crap, why didn't I listen to everybody before?\n",

      "me interested enough to last something like 64 episodes. 64?! My sweet spot is 26, anything beyond that are a commitment I'm not willing to make.\r\n",
      "The first episode was one of the best pilots I think I've ever seen, it established so many world rules and characters and really showed off the budget and animation levels I was in store for. I remember thinking \"Woah, this really feels like Avatar: The Last Airbender\" and I grew up with that. As soon as I felt that, I knew I could last 64 episodes easy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show is relatively simple, there's a form of magic called alchemy that few possess, and there are large territories that are on very poor terms with one another. You're looking at great warriors and really detailed fight scenes. The real heart of this show is the strength of the characters, main and supporting, and the overall arcing story. It deals so well with escalation, never skipping too far ahead too fast as to lose you, but it keeps a quick pace with a lot of well explained mystery that you want to know more. Each section of the story adds foundations to the parts to come, previous pieces of intrigue combine to solve a larger piece of the puzzle. This feels so satisfying to watch, be it discovering the rules of alchemy to who the villain is and what his evil plan becomes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This show can become beautifully dark, from familial deaths of main cast members, to examining how far someone will go for perfection, justice, or even life itself. The villains are wonderfully metaphorical, each being charismatic and deadly, while the heroes are very complex and quite human. Fullmetal really dissects human nature and shows you both the best and the worse of it. What pins this down is a really great soundtrack, the whole thing creates this sort of feeling that just flows into you. You name it, this show probably has it: political instability and invasions, insightful character development across the board, a good sense of humour to lighten the mood just enough that the shocking moments hurt so much worse, amazing fight choreography, a well written love story, mysterious secret societies, redemption arcs for desperate thugs...   It really has so much to offer, each piece well rounded and ready to be enjoyed. I don't know how they fit in so much without it feeling overly complicated or too stuffed, but they did!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was an idiot for not checking out this show when people told me about it, because it really is a near perfect piece of entertainment across the board. By the end, I wanted more than 64 episodes, something I never imagined happening. I can't recommend this show more, it's unmissable.\n",

Which is a shame - charecter development is just poor (and some charecters such as Mustang are just boring opposing the brilliant and loved Mustang from first part), the speed of story doesn't leave any time for good plot, idiotic deforming of animation, poor animation in general (despite huge budjet), good OST, that nevertheless fails to shine in comparison to first part and most importantly it fails to use brilliant findings of original anime\n",

Watching this whole series, i was thirsty, thirsty for more enjoyment, humor and character development  each time i finish an episode. Definitely worth watching. The older series, Fullmetal Alchemist is a good anime, so i had high expectations for Brotherhood. The story line of these two series are slightly different but the plot remains the same.

      "At first i was actually reluctant to watch brotherhood simply because i felt they were down playing how good original was. So pure stubbiness kept this wonderful experience from me, but could you blame me? There was a lot of hype about brotherhood, and to me the selling point was that it was a different ending to the same story i loved, but i later released that is far too understated of what the differences\n",

      "really are.\r\n",
      "So i finally decided to watch it after a saw the first episode on t.v. and i agreed it was a much better looking anime than original and the fact that it was still the same characters i loved, so why not see the difference. So off i went and ask my older brother for his copy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once it started i noticed immediately this anime was created for the original fan base and not an alternative to original, which ups its appeal for me. All the beginning story lines are fast passed so u don't feel your just sitting through original again, plus there are surprising changes(which i shall not spoil); so if u haven't seen original it can be a bit full on and \"a lot of info in a short time\" (as my friend who i showed brotherhood too, who hadn't seen original said) but its not impossible. i still maintain to this day too see both!\r\n",
      "Anyway, as the story progresses and you feel all secure knowing what's happening and (u think) you know where this is all going, until BANG! CURVE BALL, and suddenly your whisked away onto a totally amazing story completely different to original. These anime's stand alone! So it doesn't really matter which u start with or if u choose to just watch one (which is a same), but this said Brotherhood is better. And here's why:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well for one big point : Winry.\r\n",
      "HOLY CRAP that annoyed me in original, and my brothers can vogue that my first sentence once the movie that finishes original's story ends i seriously was like \"Ummmm wtf about Winry?! They seriously (spoiler)  just leave her!!\" and i think i cried but that doesn't matter.... \r\n",
      "In brotherhood not only do u see a lot more of Winry, you get a BACK STORY, AND DEVELOPMENT! HOLLY SHIT! And its very good. In original it was always left up to inturprritaion as too what Winry was to the Elric brothers, but now we get to see her story pan out and its supper well done.^_^. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another reason as to why Brotherhood is better than original is : The GATE/GOD/THINGY\r\n",
      "This part of the anime makes so much more sense and doesn't make me want to brake open my skull and pull out my brain. That's not saying original did amazing with what they had, i just think brotherhood doesn't stretch belief as unbelievably. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also the previous fact leads to my last reason : THE MOTHER FUCKING BEST.ENDING.EVER!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When original ended there was no sense of happily ever after. It just left off (spoiler) with that sense of the unknown, a guaranty that the story wasn't in fact over and a great big SQUID! ALL THAT SUFFERING AND THAT GREAT BIG, LONG JOURNEY AND YOU DON'T GET ANY RESOLUTION! That always bugged me but i could forgive original cause the journey was in fact amazing and i really love the beginning. But with Brotherhood, there was none of that. You know exactly were the characters stand at the end and everything is tied up with a beautiful bow! (SPOILER, not to mention babies!!! So cutttteeeeee! XD )\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So now that i've said all this before you watch brotherhood, i still suggest watching original first. I am one of though's people who saves the best parts of her food for last, or how i really think about it, end on the best flavour :) \r\n",
      "Original is longer too, so i feel you really can bound with the characters before starting Brotherhood, which makes the ending all the more satisfying! \r\n",
      "(You don't have to by any means, i just think its the best way to experience FMA)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So here's my rating for this anime:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: 10/10 a wonderful beginning, middle and end. Plus it flows organically, and you're never bored. \n",
      "\r\n",

      "This is a short review of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I have seen many of the episodes, but not all of them in order and do not consider this a proper judgement of the series.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story - 4: The story of Full Metal Alchemist is supposed to be about two tragic brothers going to search for the Philosopher's Stone that their father disappeared looking for. The laws of equivalent exchange are supposed to be really gruesome. Going out into the world and making discoveries is something really important to the Elric brothers. This impression was what made me love Full Metal Alchemist in the 2003 version.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "In Brotherhood, you do not get a big sense of any of this happening with the main characters because the first episodes that deal with these issues are terrible. They did this to save time, but it does not make sense considering that the beginning of an adventure is always the most important part to immersing yourself in the world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oddly enough, the majority of Brotherhood is based in creating its world while it somehow feels like just adding China to the equation made it a lot bigger. The oriental theme always feels disconnected from world-building and this was the same with Brotherhood even though it was detailed greatly and central to our two Asian characters. Ling was almost a decent character. It is definitely easy to like him, but his rather flat and plain character was simply hidden behind emotional storytelling cliches.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "War seems far too encompassing in the story. It seems too mundane compared to what we should expect with alchemy. There are so few alchemy users that it is ridiculous and they do not know how to use their alchemy in new ways most of the time.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Toward the final battles of the series, everyone seems shallow and it would have been fine for most of the characters to die.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art - 5: The art is good mainly because it is grounded in proper details and good lighting and such. The colors are done almost true to reality, which they were going for. The characters usually do not take up as much of the screen as your average anime and I felt that it was both effective and alienating. At worst, the environments are a bunch of empty, hallway-like rooms and darkness in much of the later parts of the anime. Cannon firing is over-used to make things look exciting. Expositions and waiting scenes are very common to allow for more cheaper art.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is also the stupid rectangle effect with things getting obliterated or disappearing. It is quite detailed, but also not effective to conveying anything. Another annoying effect is Edward's alchemy, which is always spraying electricity and gray pillars rising out of the ground.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the openings, the art was always annoyingly cliche-looking and it did not vary between seasons. Not only were they animated in an annoying or stereotypical way, but they conceptually did not form any good themes. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first ending almost worked. The drawings were done nicely, but it thematically was pretty stupid to show as a children's drawing because no kid would think to draw these things except the Megaman-esque platform jumping part. The other endings were drawn very annoyingly, much more so than the openings.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound - 4: People love stupid orchestral music. A lot of this music was made to stay in the background and it sounds very dull and monochromatic. I honestly thought that there might have been only 6 songs. There actually are probably six songs they reuse in every episode because I remember getting really annoyed at hearing a few songs that were supposed to be sinister, but just sounded idiotically simple. The music department was just bare bones.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it comes to the openings and endings, some of them could be considered the worst of all anime, but nobody would admit that. They all sound like Bleach or Naruto songs, but without half as many strong points. Anyway, \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the sound effects, they are rather comprehensive. I would have rated the sound a 2 if the sound effects were just average, but they are definitely a step above almost any anime out there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character - 4: The characters are not explored enough to give you a sense of attachment. It feels like the war is the entire story most of the time. However, the developed characters are amazing. The villains are pretty terrible. This new (or orignail) rendition of Scar was one of the few awful protagonists compared to the 2003 anime. There is also Alphonse, who supposed to made deeper just because he finds a love interest. And, Edward is just a hopeless character. He has the same personality almost the whole time despite any supposed developments. This is mainly because the comedy feels like the only time Al and Ed could have shown what their personalities are, but everyone knows how bad the comedy is here. They are simply mired in conflict after conflict without being able to loosen up in a genuine way.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of the sins are pretty bad, even Greed and Envy who get the most development. They pretty much fight and do not represent themselves with their simple to write personality traits. All that defines them as characters is combat skills and maybe some grief over what they have been doing. The Father is without character except in his background. He is pretty much a stereotypical bad guy. The somewhat tragic past of Alphonse and Edward seems to be the only thing that is supposed to carry deep negative emotion in this show, and they blew that part of the story off.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The voice actors are mismatched, making characters sound too stereotypical or too gruff (the Colonel definitely sounds too gruff) or just stupid (Lang and Greed to name two). However, I am basing it on an English dub and it is hard to really judge on voice acting because the Japanese could be loads better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment - 7: Despite many, many faults, it is possible to get engaged in this show and love it to some extent. Unlike other shows where you might compromise your beliefs and see bad aspects as good, you are prone to gloss over the bad aspects of this show because it is very enjoyable at times. As mentioned earlier, the storytelling can beat out the bland characters, which is very much like a movie. Despite the anime openings being weak and extremely generic, they are action-packed enough that you will be bound to enjoy them.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, there is still the terrible comedy which always falls flat (and would even without so much repetition of the same junk). There are still lengthy scenes that seem to be going over the same details again or showing seemingly the same scenes you saw in other flashbacks and expositions. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall - 5: I wish it could be lower considering how annoyed I was by this show.\n",
      "Cartoon Network isn’t what it used to be. As a kid, I watched CN because it had shows that appealed to tons of people, shows that had meaning, and shows that deserved to be labeled classics. Those shows are gone. Teen Titans, Samurai Jack, The Batman, Chowder, Kids Next Door, and more have been dismissed for garbage cartoons like Teen Titans Go! , Adventure Time, Ninjago, and Uncle Grandpa (No comment on those new Pokémon incarnations).

      "I never liked Brotherhood; I love it. An avid reader of the FMA manga, I stumbled upon Brotherhood on Toonami and, form there, I was hooked. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime’s protagonist, the famed “Fullmetal Alchemist” whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward’s mediator during Ed’s explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn’t focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There’s Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There’s Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime’s most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening’s singer. Plotwise, there isn’t a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.\n",
      "Well, this is my first review so please tell me if you found this helpful or not so I can do a better one the next time :)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I heard about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood from a friend of mine and I really postponed watching this show... At this moment I feel like an idiot. This show was a masterpiece in all the directions it could and after finishing it I was completely astonished !\n",

      "Story (10/10) \n",
      "\r\n",
      "OK, at the first 2 or 3 episodes I was a bit confused and couldn't understand some things, but at the fourth episode I started to get what this amazing anime\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "was about.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it is said on the synopsis, it is about the Elric brothers trying to get back their bodies, after commiting the taboo of alchemy, trying to revive the dead using it. After failing and paying a heavy bill for even trying, with the older brother, Edward, losing limbs and the younger one, Alphonse, losing all his body, only for Edward to affix his soul into an armor, the story begins as Edward Elric, the older brother, becomes a State Alchemist, one who uses his alchemy for the military, in order to have a better chance of recovering their bodies. In the 3rd episode it's revealed that they are searching for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, wich is used for ignoring the basic rule of alchemy, the equivalent exchange. \r\n",
      "Now let me tell you that this isn't the real story behind Fullmetal Alchemist. The recover of their bodies comes at the second place of this anime, cause there are some more important things to take care first... the safety of the world for example...\r\n",
      "This was a more detailed synopsis and a better one I think. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now let's move on to what I liked about the story. It is really a mind-blowing one, as the events that happened before the story started are mixed with the actual story. That combination will completely shock everybody. There are a few very important characters, everyone with his own story, amazingly explained and included in only one amazing storyline. The Elric brothers story, the Ishbal's Civil War story and the very dark story behind some unthinkable things will amaze you, but not only these, as there are some other very positive things about the story:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- The plot and it's develop is uncomparable to any another anime I've seen;\r\n",
      "- It is very unpredictable and will surprise you every now and then;\r\n",
      "- It has some unforgettable funny moments, although being quite a dark anime\r\n",
      "- It has some very dramatic moments that will stay in your mind for a good amount of time;\r\n",
      "- The battles are fantastic, very strategic and enjoyable.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there is also a negative side. Due to the rushed start, a death of somebody at the first 10 episodes that is a turning point in the story, didn't look that dramatic as it should have looked, but at the latter stages of the show, you'll understand the significance of that person's death.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a certain point I thought that the end of this anime would ruin all, like Naruto's one, when that happy, unrealistic ending destroyed it. Luckily I was wrong, as the end not even was unfrogettable, but also at that point of the story nothing came for cheap.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overrall, the story is really amazing and worth a big 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a newly made anime, unlike the version of 2003, the art is breathtaking. There is a memorable animation quality, that we even now, in 2015, do not often see. The animation in the fight scenes is amazing and very fluid. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character's design is very good too, as they are completely different from each-other. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think 'Bones' has turned this anime into a piece of art. Even the details of every character, that I greatly observe, are just fascinating.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The colours are great too, as I enjoyed very much the contrast between the bright and dark colours.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound (9/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To start with, I watched the subbed version, as I enjoy very much the japanese language. I didn' regret my choice.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character's voices and their intonation was really class. This was largely due to the elite actors they hired for doing this job. But even the ones that want a dubbed version won't have problems, cause I happened to watch one episode in the dubbed version and it was nearly as good as the subbed version.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first three openings were very addictive and I quite liked them. The other 2 openings were good too. The endings were great too, especially the fourth one.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the OST, there were some really fantastic ones for the tense, anxious and fight moments. Even the quiter ones were good and were played at the right moments.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only problem is that there is a lack of character's theme, even if there are some kind of instrumental music. That's the only reason that I'll give it a 9.\n",

      "Character (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters of this anime are all very interesting and entertaining and they all have a bond with each-other in some way. They all have different powers as well as their own ambitions and to not forget, a dark past...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we know the protagonists are the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric. Edward, also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist, or also as the youngest State Alchemist at only 15. He is stubborn, strong willed guy, leading the Führer President, the highest ranked person of the country, to code-name him Fullmetal. Alphonse Elric, the youngest brother, has a more calm and kind-hearted character than his brother. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this show wouldn't have been a masterpiece if there weren't some absolutely cool guys supporting them. I will write down some characters that are worth watching with details:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Colonel Roy Mustang, Edward's superior at the military, is a cool,  a bit arrogant (like Fullmetal) and good-looking guy, whose ambition is to become the Führer President. He is presumably the strongest State Alchemist. In addition, he has some amazing, very reliable and funny subordinates, who make this show a damn comedy at times with the way they do things. Man, that's what I call teamwork! You should definitely take a good look at them. Roy also cares very much for his subordinates and protects them with everything he can. Have a good look at Maes Hughes, Riza Hawkeye and his other subordinates cause you're going to love them. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "- The Elric's brothers father, Van Hohenheim, abandoned his family when his kids were at a very young age. In the first episodes when he makes short appearances, he looks like a cold guy, but it turns out to be different, even though he has a very dark secret in his heart...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Mey Chang and Ling Yao have comed from the East in order to obtain the secret of immortality for their Emperor with the sole purpose of gaining his trust and saving their clans. Mey Chang and Ling Yao are enemies and their battle for gaining the secret is worth a good watching.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Solf J. Kimblee is a hero of the Ishbalan Extermination Civil War and on the first episodes frequently makes short appearences in a prison, with wood handcuffs and with two transmutation circles in his hands. Well, what can I say, he is a complete psychopath, but I really liked how the heck he acted during the show. Did I forget to tell you that he was prisoned cause he refused to give the army a Philosopher's Stone they gave him to exterminate the Ishbalans and that he ate it? Oh yes I forgot, sorry.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- The antagonists in this show are all really badass, all immortal, very strong and part of the same \"group\". In that \"group\" are also 2 characters that I was completely shocked . That's as far as I'm allowed to tell you without spoiling everything, but they also have a very dark story and a very strange and sometimes confusing past.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character's development makes this anime even better than first thought. Again a big 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment (10/10) \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I enjoyed this anime from the start till the end in the same manner. If you don't like it at the first few episodes don't drop it, just give it more time, cause I'm sure you'll love it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is very important to watch all the details carefully, cause it can confuse you sometimes if you don't watch it properly. Furthermore, it starts giving you clues of what's going on behind the scenes from the first episode !!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, what can I say, I love this anime, so the enjoyment is 10.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I said, I was a bit suspicious about this anime at the start, but I think I did the best thing when I started it. It's absolutely a fantastic anime that I'm sure everybody will enjoy !\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the impressive qualities from the first series and simply polished them. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art. The misplaced comedy was removed. Nearly no scenes which are intended to be dramatic are accompanied by slapstick humor. Brotherhood‘s visuals are of a considerably higher caliber and so are its action scenes. What truly separates FMA: Brotherhood from its original counterpart however is the way in which it explores profound philosophical themes. The level of depth in Brotherhood‘s story is astounding. It avoids any form of\n",

      "\r\n",
      "First I have to say that I'm an avid animanga goer. I have seen quite some series with different genres, and I also have other favorite titles. But among all of those favorite titles of mine, FMA:B stands gallantly, as it was the only one with such intelligence and perfection I was completely at loss for words when finishing it.\n",

      "original bodies back. Everything -- and by everything I mean from their backstories, the little arc, the wonderful climax and the satisfying conclusion -- is very well-thought, well-done. Everything about the alchemy thing and the (minor spoilers maybe) Homunculus thing, they completely blew my mind. The story was so brilliant and even though it started off with so many questions and so many confusions, the expanding story and the resolution answered them all for us. This story is what I would call, smart. It is complex, but not insane. The way we gradually understand the things happening inside the FMA:B universe is thanks to this anime's gratifying explanations. We are not too dumb to understand the story, and we aren't that smart to guess where the story is going either. All the ideas are very wonderful and magnificent. You don't usually find something this clever in an anime series...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As an additional note, I really loved the ending. It was totally 11 out of 10. No spoilers from me, though.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art - The art is cool as well. They are the usual Hiromu Arakawa style, not too detailed but pleasant to the eyes. I especially liked the alchemy effects and the symbols, they are super cool.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound - WELL WELL. I have the entire opening & ending songs. From again until Rain. From Uso until Ray of Shine. I have the entire anime soundtracks, composed by the brilliant Senju Akira, the three discs of magnificence. I listen to them over and over again. I have to tell you the sound is very diverse and beautiful. The voice actors and actresses are also brilliant. Romi Paku, oh gosh, you guys know how well she voices people. Ed is no exception. The sound effects, voice acting, BGMs, and opening-ending themes are all beautiful, what else to say man?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character - There are a lot of characters here. From our main characters to the enemies. The 'gray' characters as it was initially unclear where they belonged with. Suspicions and betrayals, enemies who turn allies. These characters are blessed with distinguishable characteristics and each one of them are unique. Even the characters who only appeared for little time can be very memorable to you (I'm talking about a certain character). There aren't any useless characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment - I TOTALLY enjoyed this show. It was astounding. Breathtakingly awesome. This is not the series you could marathon in a day as you will go insane... though I doubt you can wait for the next episode til the next day. The series is very smart, and though there are some tragedies, it's still sweet, beautiful, and heartwarming. The ending doe.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as I had stated before and I will have to state it again now, is a perfect example on how a shounen series must be. Looking for a series with depth and complexity? The perfect series for you. Looking for some laughs? This series also have it, but don't blame me if you get caught up in this marvelous series, even though you didn't mean to.\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is that series, expanding on its original adaption with more action. more story, more characters and an ending that just gives off the feeling of a long journey coming to a close. Whether you agree with my opinion is up to you, but even though it currently sits as the best ranked anime, I feel the need to explain why I love this\n",

      "Story (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one that, like many journey stories, sounds simple. Two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are searching for a Philosopher's Stone in an attempt to take their bodies back following a failed experiment to revive their mother. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This simple setup is all the story really needs to engage you, and from there, you watch as the show will continually introduce more characters, more world building, heavier plot elements, without ever deviating from that simple setup. \r\n",
      "As the show goes on it becomes more and more apparent in what everything is leading up to, and you're able to appreciate the show even more for themes of obsession, moving on, wondering if revenge is really worth it, human potential for creation or destruction, how science can benefit or harm the world and ultimately, working around the theme of Equivalent Exchange. \r\n",
      "I would go into more but to avoid spoilers, let's just say these themes are expertly woven into the narrative so that it still keeps its core focus. They don't make aspects up on the spot, it feels like the story was planned to be this way from the start\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main power system, Alchemy, is very well explained in how intricate it is, how there are different types, different methods to it, what it means for different people and how it affects what happens in front of the Elric brothers.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show does a great job of building suspense, although this element is not as strong as in the 2003 series. Still, the villains are intimidating to really make their presence known, and what they have in store for our heroes never failed to surprise me. You'll see plenty of twists and turns, but the show doesn't solely rely on that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is also comedy thrown into the mix, which occasionally distracts from the overall tone, but is often put in, basically rest spots separated from drama. These jokes tend to hit bull-eyes most of the time, can be creative while also tying well to the established personality of its cast, and since you aren't always expecting a joke, it makes it more surprising when you're slammed with a punchline.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show follows the full story of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, in which the narrative had a lot more of a Shonen feel to it. This isn't a bad thing at all, as while the original was a more suspense-filled psychological show, this one is a Shonen in style and appropriately epic action, but you'll never feel like the narrative doesn't know how to get smart. The show dabbles in its mythos enough for viewers to sink their teeth into, but not so much to lose the audience in technical terms. It's an expertly crafted story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art (9.5/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One aspect that definitely improved over the last series was the artwork and animation. The original series already had fantastic artwork for 2003, with the style trying to replicate the manga in basics but still looking appealing. Every character didn't feel like the same design, even background ones looked different in some way. The action scenes were usually more limited to reflect the more psychological tone but were still pretty good. Studio BONES took Brotherhood's animation to a whole other level.  The Action scenes are consistently fantastic, with loads of detail put into every power, whether it be earth alchemy, lightning alchemy, Bradley's sword fighting, the untapped power of a transmutation circle,  or my personal favorite, Roy Mustang's Flame Alchemy. All of these powers flow beautifully into the action, and with the edition of Xing and Briggs to the narrative, there are even more standout designs to incorporate.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound (9/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was not a single opening or ending I disliked in this show. All of them perfectly replicated what was happening in the show at the time, and the background music is also solid. Not QUITE as good as 03 for some of the background OST, but the tracks very much pull their weight. The dub, seen by many as one of anime's best, is actually an overall improvement. Despite a few recastings, most of the original series cast returned for the reboot, and with the added energy and intensity offered from the source material, they get to showcase their talents better than ever before.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character (10/10)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The best aspect of both Fullmetal Alchemist series was easily the characters. Despite their simple journey setup, both are incredibly character driven shows, introducing many characters and giving almost all of them an arc or relevance in the story at some point. Although some characters like Nina, Hughes, Lust and Izumi get less time here compared to the original 2003 series, most of the others either maintain their excellent characters such as the engaging and incredibly well resolved Elric brothers themselves, the dutiful/sisterly but with a tinge of vulnerability Riza Hawkeye, the incredibly buffed and pompous Alex Armstrong, the rough and energetic Winry Rockbell, and my obvious favorite Colonel Roy Mustang, for being both super awesome, and super professional, doing a lot of important maneuvering and achieving an excellent catharsis, yet still going higher. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "While it is true certain characters like Izumi, Lust and Hughes have less screentime to develop them than previously, many other characters get even better characterizations than before such as Scar, Kimblee, Greed, Bradley, Dr. Marcoh, and especially Hohenheim, who not only gets a full character arc in this series, but also ties directly into the scheme of the main villain, as opposed to being a non-character shown very briefly at the end of the previous series with little impact. The introduction of the country Xing and Fort Briggs adds even more characters to the mix. Ling Yao, despite not being the most lovable at first, became my eventual favorite among them for having a very fulfilling development arc. The villains too, despite being less personal than previously, still have interesting characterizations, intentions, and elaborate roles to play in this puzzle piece set up.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost every character has an important role to play, with proper setup on who they are, why they are, and how they are. So many get their own arcs in the narrative that it adds a lot to the overall impact. Unlike the previous series, where a lot of the side arcs felt too periphery from the intended personal conflict, here, they add to a cohesive whole, which I think is the stronger approach. Overall, a fantastically quirky and memorable cast with captivating character depth.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This series did not have a dull moment. It continuously kept me engaged with a fantastic and brilliant story that never fails to disappoint, incredible animation, and many three dimensional characters. I highly recommend giving this series a watch, maybe even buying it as well. If for some reason you cannot watch 03, watch this one first but if you can, watch it second. Despite a rushed beginning, its more consistent style, scope, epicness and catharsis will hopefully satisfy.\n",
      "I started Brotherhood after I  finished fma 2003, so not surprisingly I thought this version was... well, it was lighter, I guess? Yes, it was also shounen too. But that didnt bother me very much, after all I'm a sucker for action. But character development was different compared to the 2003 version, or so it seems to me. It is good that ed and al didnt even think about harming another soul till the very end, but after all they've been through, I thought they would at least put some thought in it, if it made sense. Like they did in 2003. I understand\n",

      "What makes a show a masterpiece? How enjoyable it is? Lots of character development? A complex and interesting plot? Lots of symbolism and themes? Or maybe it's just based on the shows own hype and popularity? Well, it doesn't matter which it is because Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) has it all. As probably everyone knows, FMAB is a remake of the original Full Metal Alchemist (2003) series; A remake that does pretty much everything right and makes an already great series into one of the greatest series ever. For those of you who have not seen Brotherhood, it is not a \"sequel\" or copy\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "of the original, it's an alternate continuity that follows the manga more accurately than the original (original was created before manga was finished). This show is a must-watch to everyone, all ages and let me tell you why:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't want to get too much into the plot since it'd be useless reading since you're going to watch this masterpiece and find out about it's story anyways. The story follows 2 young brothers, Ed and Alphonse Elric, and their struggles in achieving their personal quest.  Edward and Al Elric attempted unsuccessfully to revive their mother using the power of alchemy. In the failure process, the elder brother, Ed, loses a leg, and the younger brother, Al, loses his entire body. Ed manages to attach his brother's soul to a nearby suit of armor, at the cost of his right arm. In the midst of their quest, there are political and military conflicts alongside the darkness of human nature (pandora's box stuff). Greed? Lust? Envy? Gluttony? Truth/Lies? All aspects of our reality that people have to overcome, and FMAB portrays it perfectly. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The plot isn't complicated and symbolic at all yet it gives off the sense of an absolutely genius masterpiece. The show is \"mere\" 64 episodes (not enough for me). Because the show was so long, it had the opportunity to develop their plot to it's fullest potential, and oh boy do they deliver. 64 episodes, and there were absolutely no filler episodes where I was left bored. Skip parts of the show? Unthinkable. Brotherhood does a exceptional job of pacing itself into laying out the foundations of the story as a collection of pieces, and then connecting them all together throughout the series to create a cohesive, masterfully intertwined, and satisfying (tragic) ending. Starting with the very heritage of the main characters and the conspiracy behind the very formation of Amestris. Then the characters figuring out the \"truth\", having to deal with painful experiences, accepting reality/fate, and really growing as a human being. Then portraying the potential and corruption of human beings. With constant sensational battles both psychological and upfront confrontation to keep the viewers entertained... To the very ending where all the questions from the beginning/middle are answered, and the viewers are taught a valuable lesson about humanity-growing up and reality-not as dream-like as we'd like to believe as kids. Epic, Touching/Tragic, Funny, Magical, Simply Amazing. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Greatest vast cast of characters in anime, period. There should be no debate. The main characters aren't given all the screen-time like other shows. FMAB shows the perspectives of so many characters (10+ maybe around 20? Yep--Amazing). What really touched me was that Ed and Al remained true to themselves until the very end. They don't change or learn anything that fundamentally changes them like most \"heroic characters\" They were originally innocent kids who made mistakes just like all human beings. Then they went on the journey to try and correct their mistakes, and through their journey, they learn that there are more things wrong with the world than their own follies; and to repent upon your sins in reality is something of an ambiguous thing... An interesting thing to look for is that although the Elric brothers are on their journey to find the philosopher stone and regain their body, they constantly give up on their quest for the sake of others, to help others, and that, is the true definition of heroism. The other characters aren't there to aid or prevent the Elric brothers achieve their goal, they're there with their own stories. Random characters meet together, and build friendship? Betray eachother/Fall in love? No. FMAB isn't childish like that. But of course, all of the character's pasts and stories all intertwine with one another as the show progresses in a ingeniously woven manner, which eventually leads up to an ideal conclusion that the viewers have no choice to be dazzled by. Every single character is memorable, relatable, and just so damn realistically portrayed with each to their own humanistic feelings. All of them are entertaining to watch as they development and everyone has a moment of truth, where they shine more brightly than the other characters; no one character is like \"the overpowered great heroic guy\" or \"the primary evil psychopathic villain\". To name a few characters that had their own story, had a ton of screen-time, and were highly enjoyable to watch: Roy Mustang (Such a heroic, respectable character, one of best characters ever), Riza Hawkeye, King Bradley, Maes Hughes, Alex Louis Armstrong, Olivier Mira Armstrong, Izumi Curtis, Solf J Kimblee, Winry Rockbell, Scar and the most important character of the entire series (more important than Elric brothers), Van Hohenheim. Furthermore as I've mentioned before, Truth, Envy, Greed, Lust, and Gluttony are all actual formed characters. Their presentations represent all the ominous presences of our reality and how we overcome them. Revenge? Defeating a villain? What does that truly mean? Killing/Getting revenge on your enemy isn't the end of anything. A purpose is never all consuming; and in fact it'll probably make you even more lonely and unfortunate. That they went out on their own again, trying to stick to a promise they made to themselves, to not be helpless, that something that is so simple and grand is the true aim of their life, a life that all of us lead, is inspiring. Beautiful~ And the most amazing aspect of the show is truly Von Hohenheim's character. The ending of the anime is one of the most satisfying and sad/happy at the same time endings to any show ever. The moment we realize that Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood wasn't about mere alchemy, and action, but themes far beyond the interpretation of many viewers that teach us a lesson about life/reality. The moment we realize, that the story was truly about Von Hohenheim and his humanity.\n",

      "Everything about the art in this show is colorful, magical and fantastic. The art is designed by different people, so the animation in Brotherhood is different from the original; imo, Brotherhood's art is much much better. The superb quality for action/battles and alchemy portrayed: There's sword/hand-to-hand combat to guns/tanks to explosions/fire to shadow attacks to alchemy magic such as earth control. The characters were portrayed a little bit differently and uniquely as well, it's something you have to watch to notice (hard to explain). They especially did a wondrous job showing the various locales of Amestris, a country that absorbed many of its neighbors to reach its current state. The sound of the show? The Full Metal Alchemist series is known for it's great music, and FMAB doesn't disappoint; no, it impresses. The openings and endings of FMAB are the greatest I've ever heard. There are 5 openings to the show and they're all addicting and great. Opening 1- Again? Beautiful~ Opening 2 - Hologram? Great~ Opening 3 - Golden Time Lover? Catchy~ Opening 4 - Period? Epic~ Opening 5 - Rain? Sad/Satisfying end~ But the openings/endings aren't the only good thing, other great soundtracks that enhance the mood for specific scenes? Check (Listen to Brothers). Good voice cast? Check. \n",

      "Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a literature masterpiece. Often in great literature pieces there are symbolic objects and characters (next paragraph), and the use of color symbolism. Black, Edward Elric wears a lot of it. Black usually represents death, and the dark aspect of one's nature--often one's own shadow. Ed wearing black represents his mourning for his dead mother, and his self-depression that is stemmed from dissolution and conflict/hardships. The darkness that precedes the spiritual light--reflection of death and destruction of old--rebirth into new/realization. Edward's hair color--yellow often represents the sun/divine light. In Islam it represents wisdom and happiness. But in some places such as Egypt, that color of yellow represents envy and disgrace. The color of yellow in FMAB often mixes together multiple cultures from the world--seen from the philosopher stone. The color green often is associated with life, hope, and happiness. However the portrayal of the color green is ironically used, for in FMAB people who are jealous and hateful towards others usually are associated with green. This may be far-fetched, but I believe that this symbolizes that in reality, with life, hope and happiness, follows death, jealousy, and hatred; one cannot exist without the other. And finally, the color of white: purity (obvious). The philosopher stone's shining of white towards the end marks the beginning of ascent from the abyss-darkness, purification of sins. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Furthermore when I mentioned how FMAB has lots of symbolism and themes about life and reality, I truly meant it. The antagonist of FMAB's name is \"Father\" and he dresses entirely in white. He fulfills the role of an almighty and divine creator; he creates 7 homonculus' and names them: Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, and Lust; the 7 deadly sins. He's supposed to represent Jesus/or a Godlike figure. Also, the marking held by each of the Homunculi are called ouroboros (picture of a circling serpent) that symbolize endless circle of life: birth, death, rebirth. Going back to the Jesus references, Von Hohenheim seeks \"Father\" at a church (duh...) and Hohenheim walks right over the water that's flooding the path (Jesus-Philosopher stone-Divine Being). But an even more symbolic scene representing the same concept was when \"Pride\" claims that \"God is only a figure created by humans; that's all there is to it. If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me, do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!\" Iron-hammer down? Ring any bells? Interestingly enough, King Bradley pins down Colonel Mustang, and he chooses to impale both of Mustang's palms (Jesus-crucification). And, my favorite: Flemel's Cross-- the one that Edward Elric has on his jacket and Al Elric has on his armor. Nicholas Flemel was the creator of this cross, and he was a devout christian that had spent his entire life studying the concept of \"alchemy\". The image of the Flemel's Cross is one where there's a serpent on the cross. There are multiple interpretations of this portrayal, but I think that it signifies the most obvious thing: crucification of a serpent (Satan). This most likely reflects the characters in FMAB overcoming the darkness of reality. All in all, probably the most important symbolism in FMAB was \"The Gate\" which was the connection between our reality, and the world of FMAB. The gate represents the phase of life, and the light illuminating from it represents spiritual growth (of all the characters). The gate closed when Elric lost his mother-- his loss of innocence. Then later once again the gate closed when ____ died in our own reality: a gateway that symbolizes problems with those that open it to see the other side, having no choice but to deal with whatever lies beyond it (temptation). Elric opening the gate to see the \"truth\". Elric's journey began because he opened that gate. \n",

Also character development is very well executed in FMA:B, and it's honestly fun to see Ed growing up as the show progresses.

I have to say that FMA:B excelled with its classical OST and outstanding openings. Two of the openings, Again and Period especially stood out for me, Period with it's catchy tune and appealing visuals, and Again with Yui's wonderful voice and maybe some of the best directing in openings to be seen.

And the rest of the supporting cast was also portrayed in a spectacular fashion, they weren't there just to support the main characters. Also, I find it rare for shows to make such good villains as there are in FMA:B. I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt for a villain as they die, but it happened here.

FMA:B probably loses some of its enjoyment if one rewatches it, as learning about the world and its events as the show progresses is one of the most enjoyable things about it, but I still wouldn't mind rewatching it.

      "\r\n",
      "Let me start off saying, I did not read the manga except the very last vol after completing both series. With that said, I did watch the original made back in 2003. I was IN LOVE with it. I loved the ending and I just thought it had so much depth. But I was well aware that Brotherhood was the remake to\n",

      "better fit the manga, so I decided to watch it afterwards.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, since I really loved the first one, I was very hesitant to watch the remake. And for those who watched the original, the first 12 or so episodes is pretty much the exact same beginning of FMA. And it was a little annoying just trying get past that, but I did watch it just in case there was a plot difference. I will say, the first episode of FMA:B is pretty much irrelevant to the entire plot. It's pretty much just a \"get the feel of the characters\" episode. But once I hit episode 13, that's where everything got very interesting. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story: 10- This anime had so much depth and emotion, that I found myself crying so hard in one episode & then laughing my butt off in the next episode. I will say, this is a dark tale of two brothers trying to restore their bodies. The plot twists that take place is just beautiful. The ending will leave you breathless. I think this anime is perfect for anyone. It has humor, action, suspense, tragedy, and a hint of romance(: Only real downfall was the beginning; I feel as if everything went a lil too fast. And in which one of the character dies (won't say which one) it's not as emotional because of the faster pace and the viewer couldn't get as attached. Only complaint about the plot! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art: 10- I will admit this anime doesn't have 100% outstanding animation compared some anime of their time or newer ones from today. FMA:B was done in 2009. With that being mentioned, it was fairly decent for when it came out and it's better than its original. Everything has a deep tone yet a delightful brightness. It's admirable. This is a somber toned anime and the animation reflect that~!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound: 10- Some of my favorite Openings & Endings come from this anime. They tell their own little story based on the storyline itself. Not to mention the animation for the EDs & OPs is head-on with the songs! The music they even play throughout the show is just flawless. You'll find yourself loving everything about the soundtracks that they play.\n",

If you're like me, you'll actually find yourself liking and even growing attached to some the deadly sins(: (They are the bad guys in the anime in case you're new to this anime) They don't over-analyze too much on a particular one, but just enough to make them either relate-able, hated, or lovable. If you've seen the original, you need to just have an open mind with a new take on the characters. Edward's dad would be one of them along  with Scar. I also really love how they introduced new characters that weren't in the original. Also, the females in this anime are strong and can hold their own, which as a young women like myself, I can really appreciate. Personally, my fav characters will always by Greed, Alphonse, Roy, & Winry. Who's yours? :3\n",

      "This is the last anime that needs another review, but I couldn’t resist. The Fullmetal Alchemist franchise’s significance to anime is rivaled only by shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. The original version from 2003 stands as one of my favourite series of all time, as it is one of the most well rounded shows that I’ve seen in the anime medium, and I believe it’s a must watch for all anime fans. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fast forward to 2009, when Bones released Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, a faithful remake to the manga, which was still being written while the 2003 version was being released (which led\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "to the overall plot diverging from the manga). Brotherhood has been critically acclaimed, and has often been considered superior to its 2003 counterpart. While I believe that it’s a fantastic show (and believe me – if the million fanboys/girls squealing isn’t enough, let me tell you that Brotherhood is AMAZING), and it does indeed do a few things better than the 2003 version, it does fall short in a few areas.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Plot/Presentation\r\n",
      "So Brotherhood follows the source material more faithfully. Does that automatically mean it’s better? Well, yes and no. One of the main criticisms against 2003 is that it diverged from the original plotline of the manga. While the original source material had some magnificent content, the mere fact that Brotherhood is more faithful doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s better. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let’s start with the flaws first. The first 10 or so episodes are extremely rushed, and, to be frank, shitty. Pivotal moments that build not only the foundation of the entire plot, but also key moments in the development for a few main characters, felt hurried, and I couldn’t feel the dramatic tension of the situations at all. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I honestly hated Brotherhood at that point, but it eventually got better. The director eventually found a consistent pace that worked for the show. It was still fast paced and incredibly engaging, but it slowed down just enough for the show the flow naturally.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main problem with the entirety of the show is the comedy. The manga had lots of comedy, and though I haven’t read all of the series, the comedy worked decently well to an extent. The show tries to copy the manga’s humour, and it just doesn’t work when brought to life on the screen. A lot of the tender and dramatic moments of the show are completely destroyed by characters suddenly jumping into chibi form for a quick laugh. The transitions between the drama and comedy in Brotherhood is horrendous and above all, inappropriate. Plus, the recurring jokes get way too old way too fast (e.g. people teasing Ed about his height is funny at first, but loses its effect). \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The world of FMA can be rather… dark, and it’s beyond me why such inappropriate comedy is placed in the most out of place situations. Luckily, like my issue with the pacing, the humour eventually became a bit tamer, but it still irked me at times.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Remember how I said that the mere fact that the show follows the manga more faithfully doesn’t mean that it’s better? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The 2003 version saw this, and it did its best to tone down the humour just enough for the show to feel more genuine. It still had the wacky FMA slapstick that everyone loves, but unlike Brotherhood, it was saved for when it wouldn’t interrupt with pivotal dramatic/emotional moments. \r\n",
      "However, it’s not to say Brotherhood does a bad job with its tender bits either. When it’s done right, it’s done well. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now before you rage on me and rate my review ‘not helpful’, keep in mind that I still gave this show an 8/10. This show has much redeeming value, hell, plenty of it. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The entirety of the story revolves around the theme of ‘Brotherhood’, like the title suggests. You see this with both the protagonists and the antagonists. You see this bond with the Elric brothers, the military, with Fort Briggs, and even with the homunculi. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The plot itself, while having some issues with its presentation, has the word ‘epic’ written all over it. The world of FMA is a grand one, and so are the rules of alchemy, which is what makes this show special in the fantasy genre. Alchemy is not magic – to obtain, one must give something of equal value (The Law of Equivalent Exchange). There are many rules of alchemy, and as the show progresses, you learn more about alchemy itself and its effect on other people, both positively and negatively. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is one of the most daring shows I’ve seen in any medium ever, as it goes beyond what the fantasy genre is usually capable of. Brotherhood has a monster of a plot, and somehow it manages to handle its many plot threads with care without seeming convoluted. Each and every subplot receives closure (for the most part) and they all have their impact on the story at large. This is hands down the best part about and so this show deserves praise for that.\n",

      "Characters\r\n",
      "For me, what I love most about the world of FMA is the characters. The story begins with the tragic tale of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, two of my favourite characters in anime.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Edward is the daring brother, the taker of chances, and the intuitive genius of alchemy for his age. He’s strong, he’s flawed, and he is the famous Fullmetal Alchemist. Alphonse is the one who stops and thinks, and throughout the story, he wishes to prove his worth and be more useful to everyone. He can be considered as the moral compass in the entire cast. What I absolutely adore about their relationship is how much they want to save each other before themselves. Edward has lost an arm and a leg, and Alphonse has lost his entire body and is forced to live in a suit of armour, yet all they care about is each other. You can’t ask for better leads like these two. They develop and flesh out nicely as the story goes on. Few relationships can be so tragic, beautiful, and touching. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood has a huge cast of side characters, and somehow manages to give the majority of them enough screentime for each of them to leave an impact on me. All the characters have their own motives, relationships, and place in the story at large, and you get to see it all. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certain characters’ roles and relationships were enlarged in Brotherhood, making their presence far more significant then in the 2003 version. For example, Winry is not only bigger a character in Brotherhood, but her relationship with Edward in particular is far more fleshed out. Winry keeps him grounded. You see her take care of his injuries, scold him, tease him, and most importantly, fall in love with him. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could go on and on about the characters, but I’ll let you learn about them yourselves. Overall, Brotherhood has a memorable, fantastic, and well used cast\n",

      "Art/Animation\r\n",
      "Bones, you beast of a studio. It’s a wonder how consistent the animation is from Episode 1 to 64. Most long running anime tend to lose its steam when it comes to production values as the show goes on. \r\n",
      "Not Brotherhood. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the animation is not always perfect, it’s still crisp, clear, and consistent. Considering the show’s length, its consistency is an achievement in itself. Equal time and care is also put in the character designs. All of the characters are definable, vivid, and full of life. The background scenery can be absolutely stunning to boot. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fight scenes range from boring to extremely mind blowing (particularly fights involving Mustang and the final showdown). However, FMA was never about the action, so I can’t really complain, as I feel that it would’ve let the show down if it were more action-oriented. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only complaint I have, albeit a minor one, is the use of lighting. It can seem a bit flat at times, but overall, this show is very visually pleasing to the eye.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Music/Voice Acting\r\n",
      "When it comes to the music, the openings and endings are where Brotherhood shines. I’ve yet to see OP’s and ED’s so memorable, gripping, and energetic. I loved each and every one of them except for the 3rd OP and ED. Even though I don’t usually listen to Japanese music, I loved the songs. Plus, when the songs are also used as inserts during any given episode, it brings the biggest smile to my face. Standouts go to OP 1 and 4 and ED 2, which is a touching pop ballad called ‘Let it Out’. Even though I couldn’t understand the lyrics without translation, it still brought a few tears to my eyes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack itself is very solid one. There is a wide range in this soundtrack, from upbeat to suspenseful, and the soundtrack is used well. I’ve no complaints. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA has been considered to be among the shows that have superior dubs than most in anime, and honestly, I could see why. There isn’t a single miscast here, and every one of the VA’s played their role amazingly well. For example, I was a little hesitant to hear that Alphonse’s VA was replaced, but all that hesitation withered away after I heard Maxey Whitehead’s portrayal of him. Her performance came of just as genuine as Aaron Dismuke’s.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It’s hard to pick out standouts, mainly because every VA went beyond the call of duty with these characters. I loved this dub that much. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a rather disappointing start, Brotherhood more than makes up for it, as it becomes a huge rollercoaster ride until its epic finale and touching conclusion. With a plot that screams epic, fantastic characters, masterful production values, and an eargasmic dub, I wish I could rate this show higher. I really do. However, the few flaws were unfortunately major ones, and they took a huge toll on the show as a whole. Consistent pacing and tone are two important building blocks that form a solid story, and unfortunately Brotherhood lacks in both areas. Nevertheless, don’t let these flaws stop you from watching this show, as it more than makes up for it. If you haven’t watched anything from the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, I suggest watching the 2003 version first and then watching Brotherhood. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now before I close the longest review I’ve ever written, I’d like to address one commonly asked question in the anime community: is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood worthy enough to be ranked #1 on MAL? While I do not believe Brotherhood is THE BEST ANIME EVER, I will say it’s among the greats, and its universal appeal is undeniable.

Moreover, this anime has an epic plotline that bounds to keep the viewer attached to the screen their watching it in.\n",

      "     Another reason why is this anime great is because of the art, sound and the characters. The art isn't really something special, its just typical animation you see in most anime but it was so carefully made and absolutely perfect that made it well worth mentioning in this review. The producers have done an amazing job with the soundtrack as well, from the opening and ending theme songs to the music playing while the story develops in each episode that just matches the situation completely. I am sure that you will love the music playing as much as I did. Moving on, the characters, generally the characters were very interesting due to the fact that each one of them had a different personality the good guys and the villains as well. There wasn't much of a character development but im sure you can overlook that flaw comparing it to the fact that everyone was different from each other.\n",

If you're a shounen fan then you probably have already watched it and if not then I suggest 100% to go see by yourself, also if you're not a shounen fan give it a shot it might even change your opinion. For all the above reasons FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets a final score of 10/10\n",

Brotherhood came out at a time where Bones was getting desperate, so they just thought \"Hey, let's just milk one of our old successful series, except not put in half as much heart and effort as we did the first time around, but instead add in more mindless action and forced humor!\" And apparently it worked. It's just a mindless kids show and nothing more.\n",

      "Brotherhood's one-note show-off pompous characters and excruciatingly loud, bombastic and optimistic atmosphere will make you drool with boredom. Ed and Al came off as more or less your typical Mary Sues. None of their actions ever had any consequences, and the narrative very rarely bothered to challenge and/or question their misguided idealism. And even when it did, their juvenile beliefs always triumphed. In the end, they were still very much the naive little children they were in the beginning of the story. Whereas in the 2003 series, the Elric brothers noticeably grew more jaded, broken and emotionally distant as the show went on, which is understandable if you witness all the stuff they go through. They came to realize the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows and that equivalent exchange is indeed complete dog crap. Very often in Brotherhood, the narrative options to bend the show's internal physics to comply circumstances to their favor. Ed and Al were just too much of fetishistic, moralistic and tone deaf idealists. Ed and Al had flaws in the beginning of the story. But as the show went on, they just became more and more Stuish. They started taking down their opponents with relative ease.\n",

      "There's nothing wrong with winning. However, if your protagonists win all the time within a blink of an eye, it just takes away all sense of tension and investment. There was never a single moment in Brotherhood where the protagonists were in actual legitimate danger. Thinking you can protect everyone is in all honesty, quite infantile. People around you are gonna die, no matter what, and sometimes there's little you can do to save them. Even when the protagonists lost in a battle against the antagonists, you knew they would always find a way to worm out of the situation, either by other protagonists making a dramatic entrance at just the right moment or through flat out dues ex ma-china. Just watch the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime from start to finish and you'll see how much more realistic, secretive, and overall thrilling the villains really were throughout that series. Yet in Brotherhood, they were all rather shallow and bland villains who lost their capability of rational thought whenever the plot called for it. If you watch Brotherhood more and more carefully, you'll see how much each and every major protagonist were shielded by plot armor just because the plot said so. Hell you even got faced-heel turn villains, most notably Scar, whose race was destructed by the military in the war, who also was shielded by plot armor till the very end and never pays for any of his actions earlier in the story. The original manga author became too much of a wimp to kill off major protagonists in later chapters after the death of Maes Hughes, a friend of the Elric brothers and Roy Mustang. She obviously gotten numerous fan letters telling her never to kill another main protagonist ever again. She became too concern with pleasing the mainstream public instead of actually trying her best to make a good story in her original manga. And by the end, her work became fully mediocre and isn't really worth reading at all after only the first time.\n",

      "The protagonists are noticeably more heroic and chivalrous in Brotherhood, as opposed to broken, depressed wrecks. Their actions very rarely stray into morally gray territory. This is a story about the military and the human beings are in it. It is suppose to be a drama and tragic series, along with it being somber and realistic. Not filled with cluster forced humor chi-bi faces every few minutes during a serious moment where the author wants you to be immersed in. Overall, her writing skills are sub-par at best and doesn't have any experience on the battlefield. No wonder why her work ended up being plain trash. Most of the background music featured in Brotherhood are not good either. In fact, some of them sounded pretty childish and were overall poorly used in most cases.\n",

The original author added so much plot devices, plot armors and plot holes into her work. And don't even get me started on the ending. Words cannot describe how much I truly despise the ending to a greater degree. All I can say is that the author was just doing a rush job and never thought anything through at all. All Brotherhood has going for it is the new animation, the villain King Bradley aka Wrath, and some of the flashback scenes prior to the start of the show.\n",

I give art a mediocre score because it isn't anything special. The story is what I have a problem with. The very idea of the show/manga is great. I like the idea of alchemy. The story quickly became a predictable straight forward festival of nothingness. I\n",

I just did not care. I give points though for when FMAB made me cry at (spoiler) funeral. I thought it was easy to guess what a Philosophers' stone was made of. I don't think this show is worth your time and you don't have to watch this show to be considered a true anime fan. That would be Cowboy Bebop.\n",
      "Extremely overrated and it is beyond me how this anime has such good ratings. The highlight of this anime for me was when Ed encounters the chimera girl, it was a super dark and sad moment that made me think the rest of the series would be of this quality. But no, it then becomes an unfunny boring cliche mess with stupidly one-note characters.\r\n",

      "Note though that I have not seen the 2003 anime nor have I read the manga ; I bring this up because a lot of people who are fans of the 2003 anime bash on Brotherhood for either being a rehash of the mythos and not having as much 'impact' as the 2003 one. I don't exactly know what they are going on about as I'm not a fan of the 2003 version but I respectfully disagree with them. That aside, why do I\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "think FMAB is one of the greatest anime of all time? Because it gets literally everything that a good story should have right and more.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For one thing, it is an epic, epic story. A lot goes on in every episode and the scale of the journey is big, spanning a whole continent plus some of its neighbors. Its one of the few modern works of fiction that deserves to be called a saga (saga means heroic journey of great length) and its world is really unique, original and actually pretty believable. Sure, alchemy is unrealistic. Sure, it does not exist. No, that doesn't really make 'realistic' anime better than FMAB. Haven’t you guys heard of suspension of disbelief?! As long as a world sticks to its own rules and FMAB does just this, I devour a work and its world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whenever I search out any work of fiction, the first thing I look for are great and compelling characters and when it comes to character, FMAB hit it right out of the park; it has some of the most inspiring, unique, compelling and relatable characters ever, be they villains, heroes, allies or even minor characters. Edward Elric never gives up no matter how much crap he goes through (yeah, sound familiar? kenshinhimuragutskenzotenmagokuetc... hey, that’s not a bad thing, it's actually a very good thing). He is a bit whiny when it comes to his pride and height but not when he goes through actual bad stuff. No, when he does you can be sure he'll try to fix it by any means possible. Al is also a very great character; looking up to his brother and helping him out with his quest to gain their bodies back and honestly, can you imagine FullMetal Alchemist without Alphonse? The two complete each other with their brotherly love and companionship and this companionship helps them out a ton in their journey.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of the Elric allies, I will not mention as there are too flipping many. However, they are all very fun, likable and when some of them do die, it's heartbreaking and haunting. Yes, even the death of THAT character that died in episode 20 or so of the 2003 FMA but died in episode 10 of FMAB was very tragic and haunting. I could not believe it and the rest of the series became really suspenseful because of that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The villains are also great. Scar is mysterious and interesting, the Homunculi are for the most part fun and even scary and Father who turns out to be the big bad is a fascinating, horrifying and a really effective villain. One thing that did bother me though and the next sentence is a minor spoiler for a character death, was that the homunculus Lust was killed off too quickly whereas according to the stuff I read, she was a much more interesting character in the 2003 version. It did bother me a little but not by much because the Homunculi Wrath, Pride and of course, Greed more than made up for any loss of her character. I think my most favorite villain in Brotherhood ha to be Wrath. He's just really scary and a very real threat to our heroes and I won't spoil who he is but it's really surprising. And then there is Envy. Biggest. Bastard. Ever. Well, except for Griffith. And Johann. And Dan'Ichiro Sanka. And Hitler. What, only fictional characters count?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMAB also has without a doubt the best depiction of women in all of fiction. Sure, there are the usual tsunderes in this anime like Winry and Izumi Curtis but they still come out as fully fledged characters and despite Winry being an engineering nerd and Izumi and Riza always moving and being utterly badass, THEY STILL COME OFF AS FEMININE. Finally, a work of fiction where a (relatively) well adjusted woman can actually be herself and acts all girly but at the same is still very competent instead of always needing to be rescued. No women pretending to be like men as if their femminity was a disease needing to be wiped out, nor are there any dumb blondes who get themselves captures or whine about being rescued!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then there is the Father of the Elric Brothers. I won't spoil his character but trust me he's really compelling and great.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Does FMAB have flaws? Well yes, but some of these 'flaws' aren't really flaws. A criticism I often heard for Brotherhood was that it didn't pack as much punch as the 2003 version. I disagree so much with this reasoning because FMAB is one of those very rare anime that brought put all of my feelings: it made me cry (those war scenes, oh my gosh...), it made me think (war is bad but can it be used to do good?), it made me angry (Envy you bastarded son of a...), it even made me happy and elated. I, an 18 year old man at the time, found myself cheering for the characters out loud when they were doing something awesome as if I was watching my favorite football team scoring a goal. No other anime or manga, not even Berserk made me do such things. Then there were the times where I was really disturbed. I think Brotherhood is one of the most violent anime out there. It's not Berserk levels in its blood and gore but it's fairly graphic especially when the Homunculi themselves are getting beaten up. However, those scenes weren't really disturbing and to me, episode 4 of the anime was one of the saddest moments I've ever seen. I did not see that moment coming and when it did, I was speechless and felt really empty inside. So to me, the idea that Brotherhood didn't pack a big punch is a non-sensical argument as it really did get a lot of different feelings from me.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The comedy was also pretty nice. Edward despite being such a badass is hysterical when he's all angry about his own height (IF YOU PRAY, YOU'LL DEFINITELY BECOME TALLER!) and the funniest joke involved Winry actually KILLING Edward with her wrench. That scene came out of nowhere and the fact it was never mentioned again made it all the more hilarious. The comedy never takes away from the mood though and like the Higurashi anime, the comedy made the characters seem closer to us and friendly; comedy when done well can actually give characters a ton of depth. Edward may never give up and he's still really smart but he's still impulsive and stubborn.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Someone else told me that FMAB doesn't stand on its own, meaning you have to watch it from the beginning in order to understand the plot instead of picking it up 20 episodes or so in and starting from there. While I am someone who thinks that works of fiction like books or films in a series should stand on their own, to me it doesn't count for TV series animated or not. TV series have a huge advantage over films, animated or not, in that they have much more time and narrative devices to explain their story and in my opinion, this should be taken advantage of. Not every series has to have an episodic format (like Cowboy Bebop which I didn't like) especially if the story doesn't call for it and why would anyone watch any series with only 64 episodes 20 episodes or so in? While it's true that episodic anime are more mainstream and probably bring in a bigger audience, the fandom that you bring in with a non-episodic anime will still be big and it will be a dedicated fandom always analyzing and dissecting your work.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If I had to name a real flaw Brotherhood had, I do think the first 10 episodes were a bit rushed. Oh they were still deep, well written and compelling but compared to the rest of the anime I agree that they were rather rushed. Sometimes the animation does look a bit off model and a character in the last episode does look a much older than he really is due to off-model animation. However, none of these flaws took away from my enjoyment of the anime and I find the story to have very little flaws. There was really only one moment where I didn't quite buy that a character would do such a thing because I always thought that this character was way smarter than she really is. Also, what on earth happened to my dear Sheska?! I want to know more about her even though she is as minor as you can get with a character!\n",
      "\r\n",
      " Either way, the plot is as close to perfect as you can get. Hell, for such a complex system of fantastic science (alchemy is not magic. Even the Catholic Church studied alchemy in the middle ages, look it up), I understood and believed everything so that when the characters did search and discuss the different forms of alchemy, I understood what they were saying and was never confused.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My final verdict for FMAB is a 10/10 for masterpiece. It is a definite must watch and while fans who saw the 2003 version may dislike Brotherhood's early episodes, I've seen just as many fans love both equally so it's highly, highly recommended. It has something for everybody, is relatively free from fanservice and it's really fun and awesome in the end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PS: About FMAB being the greatest anime ever. Lets be realistic now, while it certainly is one of the best, no anime or manga that is truly great is better than another. FMAB is part of the pantheon of great anime, those anime that have alot of  influence on the world and are also very well written.  I won't name them but FMAB is definitely one of the greatest ever.\n",
      "This really is an outstanding piece of anime and artwork in every regard, the music score is exceptional as well and very memorable.  So MANY things in Brotherhood are all memorable that you really will not be able to just select one thing first, nor will you be able to pick just one item either.  This is an anime that is hitting on all cylinders and scoring on all marks, there is little else they could've done to make this better other than expanding the story and length to increase the character depth; but, to be honest that may have been overboard. \n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Deeper characters are really the only area were they could've improved a bit, but not by much as all the main characters are hashed out very well.  It is in fact many of the evil characters that could've used some extra storytelling, but that is a hard thing to accomplish in almost any show for the bad guy(s).  Overall there is no real lack of background or dimensionality to these characters other than perhaps their personal or love relationships, which were always handled for the most part at an arm's length.  Winry and Ed's relationship out of all of them really could have used an extra bit of elbow grease, so that when the end finally arrives it really would've meant that much more to Ed, to THEM, and to US!  Adding in some fireworks for other characters would've been nice, but this WAS realistically a show based in a VERY heavily militaristic city and community.  So fraternization, much like army life in almost any country in the world, is basically forbidden until you are off-duty AND off base.  This is why Ed's relationship COULD'VE been helped as we follow them and they DO get off base and they DO go around Winry, specifically.  But, I'm complaining about nothing to be honest...the show is more than fine as it stands.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animation is wonderful and rich.  The combat especially is always great and for some reason, with this anime specifically, it has left a very unique mark on the anime landscape.  When I think of how the animation runs together and the battles there is no other anime I can think of that is remotely like it.  So far it IS a unique and one-of-kind creation.  It is definitely a anime series worth a re-watch and a re-watch after that!  It is that good and evokes so many great memories of adventure, danger, wonder, intrigue, and with that comes the fun of cheering Ed and Al on (and many of their compatriots as well)!  Getting people that have never watched this together to give it a run through is more than worth it so that they can do exactly what I just said in the sentence before and with that you can relive that experience vicariously through them; it really does make it almost just as fun as seeing it the first time...  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond the animation you have the wonderful music.  The music CANNOT be left out here...  It is just as important I truly believe as the characters, the story, the animation, and anything else that has gone into the production of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  This will be some of the most memorable music you will ever listen to in anime.  You may find yourself when done with the series seriously considering buying all of the music for the series.  The orchestral music for the main portion of the show is wonderful and while I may not like all of the ending or opening theme songs, you will more than likely find a few you do like as Brotherhood will have a lot for you to pick from when all is said and done.  The music had to be mentioned in it's own right as a separate issue, as it's so well done it deserves a lot of merit and needs to be mentioned as a reason to watch the series as well.  It IS that good!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond everything I've mentioned, some small details that I should go ahead and say is that the English dubbed version of Brotherhood is more than worth your time.  Not only is all the voice acting done VERY well, but all of the miscellaneous noises have been changed as well as things that typically are not like small text on screen (though not having to do with dubbing, it does have to do with the overall \"English adaptation\" that has been created.  The English dubbing, plus the fact that they have gone to the trouble of replacing ALL of the text (everywhere!) to English as well shows the high level of commitment they had in making sure that not only did Japanese audiences get a great version, but so did English audiences!  I will be forever thankful for that as this is easily one of my most favorite anime--it just got so many things RIGHT!  The re-watchability of this anime is very high.  Not only because it's good, but to catch the small things you may have missed the first go around; especially, if you are not someone that grabs all of the more complicated details right off the bat as this show definitely has some, the farther into the show the more that will pop-up (and more for you to pay attention for IN THE PAST)...   \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is epic, how else can I put it.  It is amazing how far you go from where you start and finally where you end at.  This IS an adventure; an adventure of two brothers that have suffered from a grievous wound, both mentally, emotionally, and physically...and to some extent it has even taken a toll on their souls...  We follow these brothers as they figure out how to repair this horrible damage they've inflicted upon themselves and in the process they make a lot of friends, they make a lot of enemies, they learn A LOT, and that simple promise they made to each other to heal each other and to free themselves of their self-made curse might be just enough to get them through anything.  They learn in the end what matters and what doesn't and they realize those that are evil simply just never learn that lesson.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall I give this a 10/10.  The weakest areas I think are characters at 9/10; but trust me this isn't a big decrease, it's more that I wish they would have added more onto characters that were already there or spent even more time on specific development areas on the main characters (I always want more character back-story...).  The next negative is the art area at 9/10.  Again this isn't a big decrease and in certain areas, like combat, it doesn't apply as they've done a spectacular job here.  Really all they could have done is added more team members and gotten a bigger budget with a bigger studio/editing crew.  Without that I'm not exactly sure how they would hit 10/10.  BUT, they have far more positives than they ever could have in the negative department.  While I don't really like all the opening or ending thematic music for Brotherhood, the actual music for the show is beautiful and basically puts a large amount of the anime produced in the garbage bin when comparing music score.  If you want an idea of what I'm talking about, just head over to Youtube and do a search for FMA: Brotherhood OST music score (CD track; I think the one you buy has 84 tracks, I could be wrong though).  Then you can listen to a LARGE chunk of Brotherhood's music--it's worth your time. \n",

      "If you enjoy anime, you can watch the first few episodes of Brotherhood easily around on the net; either on Youtube or many other places, but try to give Brotherhood atleast till episode ten if for some reason you don't like it off the bat.  Brotherhood is a \"little\" slow at the start; by \"slow\" I mean it hasn't gotten into the \"swing\" of it's main story arc.  Once THAT starts up, that is when Brotherhood turns into a roller-coaster and you are stuck in the seat until the ride comes to a complete stop!  This is easily a show I recommend to get on Blu-Ray as a blind buy!  WHAT A RIDE!\n",

      "The story is about two brothers (Edward and Alphonse Elric) that know alchemy (to manipulate objects and transform one object into another. They are bounded by the basic law of alchemy: in order to gain something you have to sacrifice something of the same value). But they have made one horrible mistake in the past. They have done the taboo of alchemy, they have done alchemy with human lives. Trying to resurrect\n",

Edward was able to replace the soul of his brother to an armor in the neighbourhood. But needed to sacrifice one of his arms for that. Then the two brothers joined the army in order to get their bodies back. From here the real story begins. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This anime is unbelievable if you think about what they all handle. The main question of the story is “what is the value of life?”. This is the question where the protagonist had problems with during the whole series. Actually the main reason why that I find this is a very serious shonen is because the way they let you see politics. It is unbelievable how good and detailed it is. You see things like corruption, racism, religion, terrorism, people with a god complex, … . The way you see everybodys thoughts and however you can completely disagree with them you understand what they think and why. The way everybody from different sectors thinks about the value of life is probably one of the most interesting things about the serie since it is combined with all the other thoughs of them. What does people do to get power/succes?, how do people change once they get it? are some other interesting questions that will be answered as well. You can really make endless compares to history. Par example the way the regime attacks a certain religion is comparable with hitler’s regime that attacked the jewish, the one from that religion that wanted revenge and became a terrorist is comparable with al qaida, ... . Thats why I think this serie explains politics even better than Code Geass.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I haven’t even talked about the homunculi yet. There even more interesting than politics. It are creatures that thinks they are the evolution of mankind since they are kinda superior to humans. But the most interesting part is that they all have one emotion. Such as lust, envy, greedy, pride, … .It basically shows what these are and what people do if they're obsessed with that emotion.\n",

      "The openings/endings are very good however the rest of the OST isn’t that good or special. The art isn’t anything special either. The characters are very good not that they are such special themselve but there just plenty of original and interesting ones. The amusement was okay but I wasn’t that exciting while watching it in the first 40 episodes. The other 24 where good of excitement but again nothing special. The fights are very original with all that alchemy shit so these where very exciting to watch. In my opinion that serie had to do it with the story and didn’t had anything too special for the rest however the story makes up for everything and makes it a absolutely a need to watch anime for every shounen lover. So don’t think it is or I find this not worthful to watch just cause I gave it only a eight. Eight is considered as very good and I don’t like to give all good shows tens cause then my favorites won’t come out my list anymore.\n",

I've seen a lot of other people's reviews and I'm constantly seeing the same pattern, which is that everyone is comparing Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to the first series, Fullmetal Alchemist. I'm here to break that pattern and say I love them both equally. I feel that one can't compare them, because both series are very different.\n",

      "I don't like when animes don't follow mangas, but the first series wasn't suppose to follow the manga and it took a totally different turn that was amazing in it's own way. For the brotherhood series (which went just like the manga), was also an amazing story. The brotherhood version focused more on the corruption in the world, while the first version still did as well, but more emotional. The first series made me cry more, because almost everything died in the series (while the second series I still cried, but got more pissed at all the corruption in their world). In other words, one isn't better than the other, because both series have their perks and fill in the gabs that each one had.\n",

And without fail, those two always stick together. There bond is just as strong in both series. For other characters, some didn't exists in the first series that existed in brotherhood. Some characters were more important/less important in brotherhood than they were in the first series, which didn't effect either stories. In both series, one either hates a character, loves them, or has no opinion on...but it's mostly love or hate.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall:\r\n",
      "One series isn't better than the other, one was meant to go by the manga and one wasn't. Both stories were amazing, truthful, and brought tears to one's eyes. I love and appreciate both series, and I hope you do too. I suggest people to watch both  series (but to watch Fullmetal Alchemist then Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, because if you watch Brotherhood first you will just find yourself constantly critiquing how the first series doesn't follow the manga...so you won't enjoy the messages each series has to offer you.) I watched the first version when I was like seven years ago and I just finished Brotherhood, and not once did I compare.\n",

      "A few years ago in my freshman year of college, I had a number of friends who were extremely into anime. Other than watching a little bit of Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Naruto as a kid, I had little familiarity with anime. I proceeded to watch a few Miyazaki classics, and then FMA:B as my first \"serious\" anime series with. So understand that this rave review is partially due to nostalgia from those days, and you may not think it is as good as I do for that reason. Nonetheless, I probably should've started with\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "a different anime, because after watching FMA:B it is extremely difficult to find anything that compares.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As you can tell from the synopsis, the plot is incredibly original. But the synopsis doesn't quite tell you how deep the plot runs as it deals with some heavy and dark themes. It is all delivered with brilliant execution that has you on the edge of your seat for the entirety of the series, especially after the first fifteen episodes or so. Though the pacing is a little fast at times  (especially at first, though this is mostly because it is assumed the viewer has seen the original first or has some familiarity with the manga), there is very little to complain about.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it is a remake of another series, it is difficult to write a review without comparisons. First of all, I would recommend seeing the original first; I did not and I missed a few details in my first viewing of the series (I have since rewatched a few times after watching the original). It is not absolutely necessary to watch the original and Brotherhood certainly can stand on its own, but it does help a little to be at least familiar with the original. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood starts out largely the same as the original series (and the manga), though paced a little faster. For various reasons, largely because of the slower pace and better character development, I prefer the beginning of the original series. After episode ten or so, Brotherhood goes off in a very different direction from the original to better follow the manga. This is where I begin to significantly prefer brotherhood as it thematically covers far more ground and develops a number of the other characters in a superior way (most notably Scar, Envy, Edward, Mustang, and Wrath). Edward, especially, is far more dynamic in Brotherhood and has a better connection to the theme of the show. While the original dealt more exclusively with the ethical implications and nature of human equality, Brotherhood deals with those themes more subtlety as well as the fallibility of human knowledge, cultural and philosophic differences between the East and West, the brutal nature of war, the ethics of retributive justice, and the role of science and religion in the formation of ethics. All of these themes are dealt with in a common thread of deep humanism, and the ending is more complete and more satisfying than the original. I could go on for days about the numerous thought provoking themes this anime delivers, but I won't and it's really impossible to do justice to the plot in this review. I give it a 10/10 for plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it comes to art, Brotherhood is slightly better animated than the original, mostly because of technological advances between 2003 and 2009. Though the animation isn't the best feature of this anime and is hardly the best Studio Bones has produced (that honor going to Sword of the Stranger), it is still substantially above average. What really artistically stands out about FMA:B is the directing style. Though it is action-heavy like most shounen anime, it avoids all of the pitfalls of the genre. There’s no campy battle cries, the battle scenes (if you can even call them that) are actually well directed and not action-for-the-sake of action, everything isn’t immediately explained to the viewer by the participants in the battle, and the points of interest are not the battle scenes in the first place or even the powers the characters have through alchemy--but the quiet scenes where the characters reflect on their situation. It is the only shounen (other than perhaps the original) I’ve seen that I could call cerebral and reflective. There are a number of fascinating camera shots and interesting directing decisions throughout the series. For example, the way the entire end scene of  the episode “Backs in the Distance” is directed is some of the best cinematography one can ask for (you’ll know what I mean when you see it). Though there are a couple moments, especially near the beginning, where the atmosphere of the anime is a little tainted by some childish humor and over-done jokes about Ed’s height (it’s easy to forget amongst all the genocide and references to classical epistemology that this was marketed to a younger audience), it is overall very well directed.  It gets a 9/10 for art.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it comes to sound, there’s a bit of a dilemma here. It may be a controversial opinion, but this (and the original) is the absolute only case where I prefer the dub to the sub. Ed’s voice in the sub sounds like a stereotypical and--to be honest--a little annoying shounen protaganist that does not do justice to the depth of his character, and Alphonse just comes off as whiny in the sub, almost reminiscent of a uke in a bad yaoi. Other than that, the sub is decent and doesn’t really detract from the series overall; but the dub is where this anime really shines. Vic Mignogna does a brilliant job as Edward Elric, and the rest of the cast, with a few exceptions, act very well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soundtrack also bears worth mentioning. I actually paid $50 plus shipping from Japan to the US to buy this soundtrack, that is how good it is. I listen to it quite a bit and many of the tracks are beautiful and match the scenes they are put in perfectly. This is among the best OSTs for anime you will find out there, and even overshadows some of the elements I do not like  at the sub. That said, the OST probably could’ve used a bit more tracks as it gets a little repetitive towards the end. For this reason, I give it a 9/10 for sound.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters in this anime are also extremely well done. Almost all the major characters are highly dynamic with deep back stories, and even the more minor characters are highly likeable and contribute significantly to the plot, with a few exceptions. And the connections between this anime’s intricate plot and deep themes and the characters go well beyond what almost any other anime does. Most of the characters are also vehicles for symbolism. Brotherhood goes far beyond being good in the department of character symbolism, and ventures into being an exemplar of what anime can be as an artform. 10/10 for characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clearly, given the way I’ve been raving about it and the fact that I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rewatched it (I’d guess around six), it’s fair to say that I think this anime is enjoyable. And not just enjoyable in the sense of entertaining (though it certainly is) or even enjoyable in the sense that you tend to lose yourself in the story (though you certainly do), but it is enjoyable in the sense of being completely enlightening thematically, as I’ve said before. If you want to think deeply about an anime, look no further than brotherhood. I even went as far as to use brotherhood in a college paper to illustrate some philosophical implications of Richard Rorty’s rejection of Cartesianism (granted, it was for a seminar on anime). Even if you don’t really want to think about an anime intellectually, it is enjoyable just for the sake of being a good story that you can lose yourself into. Whether you want a deep thoughtful anime, an action-packed shounen that you can get excited about, or just a good story to simply enjoy for its own sake, Brotherhood delivers. I typically use it as the go to to introduce newcomers to anime, and as you can see from its place in the rankings, it is much beloved by the most experienced of anime viewers. 10/10 for enjoyment.\n",

      "As of the writing of this review, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood sits at number two overall on the MAL list, and has historically taken the number one spot on many occasions (and probably will again in the future). If you haven't seen this before, then, you are probably approaching it with extremely high expectations. Typically when people approach a show with that high of expectations, they are disappointed. FMA:B is an exception to this. It competes for my absolute favorite anime, and tops the favorite lists of many others, for a very good reason. Call me an otaku fanboy, but I can’t rave about it enough. There are only two animes I’ve ever seen that I’ve given a 10/10, and this is one of them.\n",

      "Story is awesome, the “Elric brothers” Al and Edward are on a quest to find their bodies because they lost it because they were trying to resurrect their mother, which was clearly impossible to do and they would punish for it. The story is set in 1914 even though people wear clothes that were in the modern day in 2000s. Edward lost his arm and his leg and Al lost his entire body and his soul was put into a metal armour. Later on the “Elric brothers” gets help from the military, their teacher, the emperor’s son and the lady mechanic Winry. So Edward and Al started to train for their journey because they will fight tough enemies, I mean tough. To be honest I like how they wrote this story into a well ordered fashion and you can feel the emotion and tremor in this anime, and the epic battles. To be honest I have never witness a weak character at all or terrible dialogues, thank god for that or this anime would have gotten a little lower rating. But the bad thing about it is how predictable the story was. You can tell that something was bad to happen to the characters, for example if you see a happy moment between somebody, something bad happens to them. Can you believe they made 64 episodes! OMG 64! I thought it was going to be those anime that had a maximum of 25 episodes, there are no fillers.\n",

      "In my opinion the character design sucks, the people in the anime look like characters from the 1990s, I mean look at the characters! To be honest, the characters look chibi and you comparing a three year old to a 35 year-old man there’s no fucking differences! But the art was nice and the animation was fluid, the environment look beautiful and the fights do not look like Naruto Shippuden that the animation sucks balls when they are fighting. Sound there are not much songs in the anime to be honest, I heard about ten which was depressing. Voice acting was great even in the English Dub, but think about this. Hellsing Ultimate’s voice acting of the English Dub was fucking terrible, we all know that, but when compared it to Fullmetal Alchemist, is like comparing the game Last of Us to the game Ride to Hell: Retribution.\n",

      "There are no weak or terrible character roles in this anime but I knew that the characters that were going to die, it was very predictable. Edward is a short little guy that can be very hot tempered and he can be very funny at times, overall he is a very good older brother to Al and he tries his best to protect him. Al his not so as “cool” brother, deeply cares for Edward and he wants to get body back as much as Edward. Winry is a love interest to Edward, she was friends with him since they were little and cares for him as well. Roy Mustang is one of my favourite characters in the anime because he is badass. He has fire power which cannot work when it is raining, “physics.” He partners with his lover Hawkeye which has no ability but she an excellent marksman, even though she is so serious and yet her character design is so unserious. The bad guys in this anime are pretty cool because they are not those bad guys that are just bad for no explanation, they do very evil stuff. The main antagonist Father aka “The bearded bastard” he is like a Xemnas from Kingdom Hearts, he wants the power of God and he is required to sacrifice souls to do that. The bad guys you will hate them because how evil they are, well no shit there the bad guys. I thought the characters were great and the makers put a lot of effort on them. \n",

      "The fight scenes are awesome, they have characters using strategies to find ways to beat their opponent and they have to go through a pretty bloody battle and crazy bloodshed. There was important conversation that made me understand the story more. The characters are pretty amazing. I enjoy almost every bit of the anime, but some points of it was shallow, a bit boring causing me to skip some episodes. I like the characters they keep the show going and make it less boring and dull. The funny moments are hilarious and they will make you laugh. Edward becomes depress and angry when people call him short, but he grows in many episodes later. I love the enjoyment in the anime.\n",

They weren't enough songs to the anime and I wish they made the characters look less chibi. Some points of the story were predictable but I did love it.  I give praise to the creators for making an awesome anime. I recommend you watch this anime, thank god that they made it.

He despised his dad since the very moment he left his mother to die. Ed loves his brother more than anything else in the world and basically carries Al’s burden for him. His main goal is finding the philosopher's stone and that’s what he would like to do more than anything else in the world, just to give his brother his real body back. Edward began as an immature character, which developed him into a more understanding person as time went on and got a lot of reality checks on the way. At first, Edward made the mistake of thinking alchemy could solve everything, but as time passed that idea faded away and started crumbling, the idea got confirmed once he met Shou Tucker and saw Nina merged with their dog.

      "All of Fullmetal alchemist brotherhoods’ openings are simply outstanding. Again sung by YUI is a phenomenal opening, amazing story telling, amazing song, amazing visuals and all by all a fantastic opening. It starts out by showing the complete backstory of Ed and Al from Hohenheim's perspective in only just 10 seconds. After that it transitions to a heart bursting in flames which consumes the home of the Elric brothers as they are standing in front of it. In only a few shots you get to take a peek into Al’s head thinking if he will become human again. It has a shot of Maes Hughes and Roy Mustang covering each others’ backs but once Mustang turns around he looks horrified, indicating Hughes’ death.Its got great compositions, and even amazing action scenes. This opening truly is one of the best openings of all time.\n",

But it misses some consistency, jumping from one color pallet to another, switching scenes out of nowhere. But that doesn’t mean this opening is all round bad. It has some great individual shots of a lot of antagonists and homunculi, including Scar, Gluttony and Lust, Envy, Wrath showing off he is a homunculus for the first time, and Father, showing only his body to add a mysterious factor to the opening. \n",

Showing off Kimblee for the first time, showing him in flames, hinting that he has done something terrible. After that he gets shown with a philosopher's stone on his tongue, indicating that that was his goal all along. Getting the philosophers stone and gaining an immense amount of power. It shows Olivier Armstrong located in Amestris, at Fort Briggs. Showing she has an army and isn’t scared to fight back. It shows Edward seeing Alphonse’s body for the first time since it disappeared, and you see Ed getting pulled away by shadows into Envy’s mouth. \tReaching out his hand, going back to him laying on a grass field realising he can’t do anything about it. \n",

It doesn’t focus on certain characters, but it focuses on all of Amestris at the same time. The citizens to the Ishvalan people, and the military trying to fight back against the plans of Father and the other homunculi. Even though the rain is supposed to wash it away, all of the characters are still covered in dirt and blood. And the city is covered in flames. In the later parts of the opening it starts to brighten up, the sun breaks through the clouds and Ed sees his mother walking towards him. And then it switches to Edward laying in bed indicating that everything is totally fine and it was all just a bad dream.\n",

The show had some amazing animation, from smoothness to landscapes to character designs. From the beautiful art direction, to the breathtaking music to a beautiful story.

      "Directed by Yasuhiro Irie and produced by studio BONES, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a 64 episode adaptation of  Hiromu Arakawa‘s original manga and a tangential successor to 2003’s ‘Fullmetal Alchemist‘. Heralded by many to be one of the greatest anime of all time, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ (hereupon referenced simply as ‘Brotherhood‘) could be considered a ‘rite of passage’ into the depths of anime fandom and/or the anime ‘sphere’ in general by many an anime fan. Thus, three years following my traipse into the world of anime, I approached this beast tenuously and left with my emotions and opinions varied. Did I like ‘Brotherhood‘? Yes,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "quite a lot in fact. Is it the greatest anime of all time? Not by a long shot. The following review will take into account the factors of story, animation, sound and characters, each component ultimately attributing to a final score. Note that this review is entirely subjective (thought it attempts on the whole to be as objective as possible) and I welcome  open discussion in the comments below…\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Story – 8/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The initial story of 'Brotherhood' is by and large very simple: two brothers set out on a journey to fulfil their goal(s) and encounter many obstacles along the way. Indeed, everything that occurs during the course of the 64 episodes could be seen as 'yet another' obstacle preventing the Elric brothers from achieving their goals and I believe this is where 'Brotherhood's story shines: a typical shounen presents the viewer  with the main character and their goal(s), e.g. Naruto and his ambition to be Hokage, Luffy and his search for the One Piece, etc. A good or great  shounen presents the viewer with the latter whilst proffering a story that doesn't feel like a buffer and content that doesn't appear a preventative measure taken in order to elongate the shounen (an issue that to this day has prevented me from finishing 'Dragon Ball Z'). In this sense 'Brotherhood' is an astounding success: everything that occurs - every arc, every character introduction, every seemingly misplaced scene - contributes in some way to the shows larger, overarching story, blending into a whirlwind final set of episodes that leave the viewer in awe of the anime's scope and the writers vision. Coherence and a fulfilling culmination in a series longer than 50 episodes is a feat in and of itself, never mind the fact that said story is both gripping and enthralling. For 64 episodes, the viewer and the characters alike are left to follow a trail of breadcrumbs, minor story details that are just enough to keep the viewer satisfied till the next 'big' expository plot-point, leading to a conclusion that delivers on its promise of a full loaf (my apologies, time to stop with bread analogies...) and then some! Even the chemistry, physics and biology of the 'Brotherhood' world were interesting, alchemy being a well developed concept in its own right, bar a few 'it's an anime' misgivings...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All that taken into account, I suppose a question must then arise: why only an 8? 'Brotherhood' is 'deep', philosophical, waxes and wanes poetic and hell - it even resolves battle sequences in the 21 minutes within which they begin (I'm glaring at you, 'Dragon Ball Z'...)! But there are several issues - minor niggles - that mire an attempt at otherwise cohesive storytelling: the presentation of thematic issues, the inconsistent tone and a flat, uninspired ending. 'Show don't tell' is a literary technique employed to allow experience through subjective observation rather than objective exposition: one of the minor issues I had with 'Brotherhood' stemmed from it's presentation of it's thematic issues, it's almost dogmatic preaching of them and it's over reliance on a didactic formula, harbouring no trust in the audience to draw their own conclusions - an irksome 'flaw' that cropped up on occasion and left me rolling my eyes once too often. 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' was and is the epitome of 'show don't tell' done well and all too often 'Brotherhood', in spite of it's 17+ rating, falls into the rut of 'typical shounen' and speaks to its audience as though they are children, leaving an unsavoury taste once the initial digest in complete.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My second issue - and the most 'distasteful' - is that of the show's inconsistent tone. From the offset, 'Brotherhood' is dark and gritty and whilst humour on occasion is not at all unwelcome (and is often done well within the shows 64 episodes), the constant inundation of poorly timed 'jokes' and attempts at humour draws the audience out of any semblance of immersion they may once have had. For example - and a minor spoiler here for those of you who want to go in completely unspoiled - there is a female character in the show who, like the Elric brothers, has committed alchemical taboo. She loses her ability to have children and other organs as a result and during the course of the show - for comedic effect - constantly and consistently vomits blood, a running gag that is neither funny nor appropriate given that this happens only moments after her immersive 'back-story' is presented to the audience. This level of inconsistency is strange and spoils an otherwise totally immersive experience, again, leaving me only to roll my eyes as yet another serious moment is concluded with yet another cliché gag... That said, the constant mocking of Mustang's inability to use fire alchemy when it rained was never unwelcome, poor wet matchstick that he was.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My final gripe - and it is a minor one - is that of the ending which is at once fulfilling and yet leaves something to be desired. I can't obviously divulge too much without meandering into spoiler territory, however I can say that - on a positive note - all of the major and minor plot points are tied up: nothing is really left to the imagination (minor romantic interests aside). My problem however, was its simplicity - a level of happiness that did not entirely befit the shows thematic aspirations. I'll leave it at that and to you, the viewers discretion to decide whether or not the ending was entirely satisfactory, but I digress...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Characters - 7.5/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are another major selling point in 'Brotherhood' the quality and development of even some of the minor characters leaving me in amazement. Each character is more than a cliché or a trope; the dynamics between them leaves a lasting impression on the audiences that causes the latter to care for each individual far more than in most anime, leading to a roller-coaster of thrills and frights as each character edges closer to and overcomes various threats, both seen and unseen. I think it's also important to note that characters do die in 'Brotherhood', that 'Game of Thrones', 'Attack on Titan'-esk quality that makes them so popular and so addictive. Even the various antagonists are developed enough that, when/if they die, the viewer is left feeling emotionally conflicted, contrary to the expected feelings of overwhelming satisfaction. I do feel however - and this is my only gripe, major though it is - that some characters are more developed than others (one word away from an 'Animal Farm' reference there...): characters who are developed to a greater extent in 2003's rendition are often times less so in 2009's adaptation and this unbalanced approach to character development has multiplex effects on an anime that would have otherwise flawless characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Take the character Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong (a full title awarded here for emphasis): what purpose does she serve other than to be the 'bad-ass female'? She's angry, she's broody, she hates her wimpy brother...and that, dear viewers, is all the show has to offer from the good Major. Compare her to Mustang or even Winry and one begins to see that a character who is prevalent for at least most of the shows latter half pales in comparison to even the main characters love interest! Lust, whose character development truly pales in comparison to her 2003 counterpart, is relegated to the role of the mere and simple villain, a character development crime if I've ever seen one. The main villain(!) who is seen only fleetingly throughout the show till his back-story is fully divulged elicits no greater reaction than acknowledgement and at worst negligible sympathy, paling again in comparison to the shows other, 'minor', antagonists... It's a shame, really, one the deducted from my enjoyment of the show and one the forces me to give the shows characters a good, but borderline average rating... And don't even get me started of Alfonse and his good damn apple pie (which, might I add, we never see him eat!).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Animation - 7/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In any anime over 24 episodes there are going to be animation issues. Don't misunderstand me, 'Brotherhood's animation is at almost all times 'good', edging towards at the very least 'very good', but I was never truly impressed. Colours are often flat and uninteresting and character designs somewhat strange (e.g. Edward's telly-tubby-esk strand of hair and Mustang's overly-round head...) and on occasion the background details leave something to be desired. That said, 'Brotherhood's animation is almost always crisp and battle sequences are vibrant, detailed and enthralling - fundamental necessities when one considers that we are dealing with alchemy (i.e. magic). As the show progresses and the scale of battles increases, not only does the animation remain as detailed above, it actually increases in quality, giving those final battles the extra umph required to making them that much more interesting and that much more intense. There's not much more to be said of the animation other than that its quality stand on par with the shows quality - and there's not much more you can ask for from a shounen now, is there?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Sound - 7/10]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'll be honest: a part from a few select tracks, I didn't entirely notice 'Brotherhood's soundtrack... It was satisfying and valuable, don't misunderstand what I'm saying, however, in moments without tension or on such an epic scale, 'Brotherhood's soundtrack becomes simply ambient noise. 'Sound' quality is of course one of the more difficult categories to rate as ones enjoyment of an anime's soundtrack is fundamentally and entirely subjective: my favourite opening was the first and my favourite ending was the fourth, however, that said, I've spoken with others who've watch this anime and whose opinions differed entirely from my own to both extremes. Ultimately, in my opinion, it was good, however I leave it for you, the reader, to decide whether or not you enjoy it. If at this point the story and characters alone are enough to interest you, then I suggest you go and watch 'Brotherhood' now; the soundtrack is complimentary and will only add to your enjoyment of the show. That said, it's not one that I would personally go out and buy...\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Conclusion]\n",
      "\r\n",
      "‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a great anime, one that anyone who calls themselves an anime ‘fan’ must watch at least once in their life and one that will be spoken about for years to come. A compelling and cohesive story, with excellent characters, impressive thematic breadth and crisp, clean animation that is pleasant to the eye, ‘Brotherhood‘ excels as one of the greatest shounen offerings to date and – best of all – it has no filler! A miracle if I ever did see one. In all honesty, I’d recommended – if you have the time/the patience – watching the original 2003 anime first, if only to see character development in characters who severely lacked it in this rendition. And to my overall enjoyment… Despite several flaws in the presentation of an otherwise wonderful story and lopsided character development… I loved almost every minute with this complicated and personable cast whose stories (bar a few…) ended beautifully and whose presence is still felt, long after having finished the show – and if that’s not the sign of a good anime, I don’t know what is…\n",

      "Look, FMAB is an epic tale. I really enjoy watching it, but there is just something that really disappoints me every time I watch another episode: The pacing is too damn fast!  The only thing they accomplished with this series is to tell the story of the manga as fast as they could...Like a heroine shot straight in the veins...\r\n",
      " I loved the first series: FMA. Even though the plot was different there were so many more moments that really captivated me emotionally! But I couldn't feel any of this in FMAB...They could easily have made 100 episodes without one single filler, but somehow\n",

      "As a manga, Fullmetal Alchemist was met with resounding popularity right from the start, and after only two years of it’s ten year run, the demand for an anime adaptation was overwhelming. Studio Bones took up the production, but with the manga not even a quarter of the way finished, they were left with a pretty big lemon to deal with. Fortunately, they were able to make lemonade by writing an entirely new story using the material they were given. The resulting anime was an immediate success, among fans and critics alike, winding up on more than it’s fair share of top ten lists since\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "then. And yet, despite the fact that it was universally loved and critically acclaimed across the board, there was still heavy demand for a more faithful adaptation. Thus, in 2009, only one year away from the manga’s end, Brotherhood was born.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From an animation standpoint, this show was working with a relatively low budget. This is nothing new, of course... Japanese animation has always used a lower frame rate than American animation, and often look cheaper as a result. Low budgets are fairly common, but what really differentiates is how different shows manage their budgets. By using key frames, speed lines and other useful tricks, you can cut corners where it won’t be noticed, and save your money for the moments that need to move more fluidly. If you do this well, most audiences will never notice the difference. The original series was incredibly good at this, but unfortunately, Brotherhood is not. The key frames are a lot more blatant, as frozen heads can move their lips for several seconds at a time while people in the background just sort of freeze into bluish blobs.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rarely ever complain about an anime‘s artwork, as it’s rarely ever a problem for me, but it has to be said... Brotherhood’s artwork is lazy. It is plagued by choppy, jagged outlines. You may not notice it in far shots, but whenever any character has a close-up, it can’t be avoided. The only exception, that I’ve seen, is with it’s openings.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While we’re on the subject of openings, me gusta.  They are all spectacular.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the English dub, let’s keep this brief. It is every bit as good as the original’s. There are a few changes made, but none of them are bad, and yes, Maxey Whitehead deserves to have a statue built in her honor.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, with all that out of the way, let’s talk about what really matters... The story.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I first decided to try out this series, a friend of mine warned me that the first few episodes were basically a rehash of the material from the first anime. What she failed to mention is that by a few episodes, she meant the first thirteen, and by rehash, she basically meant cliff notes. Brotherhood gets off to a horrible start, pushing out a pointless Ice-Alchemist episode purely for the sake of fan-service before moving onto the rest of the rushed material. 26 episodes are crammed into thirteen episodes, and by god it feels like it. The pacing is jarringly terrible, the stories are rushed, we get barely any background material devoted to the Elric brothers’ childhood, and key moments of their past are told to us rather than shown to us.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Example:  Remember how a certain piece of Winry’s backstory was revealed to us in FMA? We opened on Winry, as a child, crying her eyes out at the table while taking her anger out on the boys. Not only were her actions genuinely and believably child like, but it gave serious insight into Pinako’s distaste for the military, and foreshadowed the fate of Trisha Elric. How was this key plot point revealed in Brotherhood? Winry sat next to Hawkeye and told her about it. No emotional impact, just exposition. And that’s just one example. Show, don’t tell, people. This is basic stuff here.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the biggest problems with the anime is shown right off the bat during these episodes, and never really goes away. From a dramatic standpoint, Brotherhood suffers greatly at the hands of it’s own poorly timed gag humor. Some of the most deep, emotional moments of the series get their serious tone blown away by ugly, unfunny super-deformed moments. Even when the boys are lying on the ground in pieces after an encounter with Scar, they still can’t escape this.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In any case, once this little catch-up session is over, the story starts to get a lot better. The pacing finally becomes bearable, as bold new ideas... At least they’re new to those of us who haven’t read that far into the manga... Are introduced. Familiar characters like Kimblee, Scar and Dr. Marco wear out their welcome, but at the same time, a flurry of compelling characters are introduced. Ling Yao, Lan Fan, and May Chang are outstanding, and their arrival placed a stamp of individuality on the show that it frankly didn’t have until then. We’re introduced to the country of Xing and the practice of alkahestry, two concepts that never stop being interesting.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certain characters sorely missed, but not so much that we can’t appreciate the presence of Olivier Armstrong, one of the most captivating characters in the entire franchise. A small selection of characters are actually handled and developed better than they were in the original show, with a few examples being Riza Hawkeye and Envy. Some interesting ideas are explored through Gluttony, but I still miss his puppy-dog loyalty to Lust.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a high point that goes on for a very long time.  To be honest, for a very long stretch of episodes in the middle, I was seriously considering giving this series a solid 8, but then there's the ending... An ending went so far over the top with it's sickeningly happy Disney resolutions that I had to knock it down a point.  I can't really talk about it without giving away spoilers, but this show goes so far to have all good guys win and all bad guys lose that some of the resolutions are just insultingly stupid.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All in all, this series was quite disappointing. The first thing anybody says to promote it is that it's faithful to the original manga, but that often feels like more of a restriction than an advantage. With fans world-wide clamoring about it being a masterpiece, I had high expectations for it. It’s not better... Not by a long shot. It never reaches the depth or complexity of the original, but as a stand-alone, it’s still a pretty decent show. It’s got some serious, jarring flaws, but it still brings to life an exciting fantasy adventure that fans of all ages can enjoy.\n",

Story has sweet romance aswell, I would've literally killed for a kiss at the end atleast but oh well, still trust me you will love it, it will make you blush :3.

The pace flowed perfectly throughout each episode, adding both drama, suspense, comedy, and even some hidden romance. The theme was clearly stated at the beginning as \"Brotherhood\", of course, but also love, family, friendship, acceptance, and even sacrifice. There were no fillers unlike the original, and everything connected perfectly like a puzzle piece. I found no cliche bits, and felt they established the \"normal\" very early on this time.

And even throughout the anime, I found the character's appearances changed throughout the 64 episodes, then they would with another anime with over 300 episodes. Even Al changed with his little hair piece was enough.\n",

I do think Vic did a better job on this one then the last because he knew the character more the second time around. Maxey was perfect for Al, even though at time I could hear a girlish tone, but it did set the character very well. And the rest of them, each character had a distinct voice and attitude. \n",

      "One thing I really liked about this series was the art. At no point did it go through a strange art shift that made everything seem off and awkward. What I really liked though was the effects of objects created with alchemy. The characters often created objects with alchemy that had uneven patterns. At first I thought it was strange, then I figured out that it was a brilliant idea as it allowed you to distinguish the difference between some objects created with alchemy and objects that were created through other means.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The voices of the Japanese cast was very good. I never felt annoyed by their voices. One of the problems with this series is that the music was never something memorable for me. I remember the events and the characters of the story, but the music was always something that was in the background that I never took notice of. The sound matches nicely with the events and do not feel awkward at least.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters were great in this series and many of them were well developed. Nearly all of the major characters receive some sort of flashback that tells you more about them without killing them off. This helped a lot in the development of characters and establishing the atmosphere and motivations of characters in the series. It was done very well compared to some of the other series out there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I felt that this series was pretty good for a Shounen series. Considering the amount of brainless overpowered main characters out there, this was one of the few that strayed a little from that formula in order to give us something different. Though the characters do suffer from a tragic past, the main characters rarely beat their opponents through brute force and willpower. We learn a lot about the primary villain and numerous characters receive a fair amount of screen time that helps develop the characters further.\n",
      "After watching the original fma you are filled with dread with the thought have they managed to muck up a classic the answer NO.

      "Hiromu Arakawa's Fullmetal Alchemist is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It is larger than life yet deeply personal. It touches on loss, the meaning of life, cultural diversity, the dangers of science, Nazism, the Iraq war, and the list goes on. Arakawa seamlessly weaves so coherent a story from such divergent threads that it mirrors the skill of a first-rate novelist. She is a brilliant world-builder and her characters are exceptional.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For instance, Arakawa's representation of women breaks with convention. There are strong, independent women like Izumi Curtis, Riza Hawkeyes, and Olivia Armstrong. These characters are complex and unique, as one can\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "notice from each character's distinct source of independence – confidence (Izumi), resolve (Hawkeyes), and leadership (Armstrong). There are tenderhearted mothers like Gracia Hughes and Trisha Elric; and those who cannot be captured by such umbrella terms like Winry Rockbell, Maria Ross, and May Chang. I suppose it's only natural for Japan's most successful female mangaka to embody such an ambitious project – to portray the totality of womanhood: thèse, antithèse, et synthèse. Furthermore, she gives plenty of time and space to include the backstory of every character. None of them has an uninteresting backstory and they all somehow play key roles in this mysterious world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite the presence of alchemy, the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is very similar to ours. It is full of racism, hatred, war, greed, love, compassion, and courage. Alchemy is used as a metaphor for power, knowledge, and science. It seems magical at first, but one soon realizes that its rules cannot be bended much like the laws of nature. Even though they have such a powerful tool, we keep encountering those who wish to go beyond its limits. Alchemy is, arguably, a reflection of our weakness. As the philosopher Julian Savulescu noted, humans are much better at solving abstract problems than learning how to work together as a whole. Edward's final decision in the show alludes to Arakawa's message that we do not need to rely on knowledge and science to lead a meaningful life. Instead, we need to accept the human condition. Similar to Aristotle's notion of the Good Life, Ed and Al choose to pursue virtues like friendship, altruism, humility, and compassion. Humanity was not meant to know everything, and the human condition bids us to focus on the Good rather than the Truth. It appears that Arakawa is a pragmatist– knowledge is useful insofar as it is practical.\n",

The people in this show have there own original personalities and these all evolve beautifully over the span of the show, the like of which I have never seen before. The characters and the development of them cannot be understated in FMA:B\n",

Not only did they score one television anime based (for the most part) on Hiromu Arakawa's amazing manga series, but the same studio who made that one, Bones, decided to later do an even longer series based even closer to the manga. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was one of those things that I thought was just going to be summarily dismissed as a novelty for the manga readers. I personally didn't care whether there was an accurate version of the manga in anime form. I loved (and still love) the first series and movie, and if I want the\n",

      "My one objection to the treatment of the narrative is that, much like in the original manga, it relies on these big sensational \"moments\", which are cool to read/watch, but ultimately take away from the verisimilitude of the work as a whole. All you end up getting are a bunch of puncuations that take away from the subtlety of the themes. \n",

The affable, but wicked Greed (my favorite character). The king of trolls, Envy. The badassery-oozing-from-every-pore King Bradley. The adorable May. The butt monkey Yoki. The distant father with the weight of the world on his shoulders, Hohenheim. Some great characters. \n",

The character designs are much closer to Hiromu Arakawa's art in Brotherhood than they were in the original series. The backgrounds and foregrounds can be quite beautiful, if oddly like watercolor paintings at times.The animation is mostly pretty good, though there are times when it noticeably isn't, and it's pretty clear certain episodes have a much higher quality animation than others. \n",

      "A large part of bringing the characters alive in an animated television series or movie is the voice acting. In the manga, you just imagine the voices, but in animation, voices are provided, and ideally, these are voices that you will closely associate with the characters, so a strong cast is valuable. Fortunately, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has an excellent cast.\n",

Alchemy is made out to be the first law of thermodynamics in a less abstract form (how energy cannot be created nor destroyed).

However, although there may be a different opinion among those who have taken the time to watch both of the series, but I personally believe that enrichment in the FMAB series of 64 episodes is superior to the older dramatized FMA series.

This show definitely is my favorite at this point, but even in that light, I still have just one issue. Characters take quick risks and life changing actions for emotions of past beloved people or wish it so, but never do they feel to me that they are attached until the rap up of the story. So if you are for swift feels, then you should realize that you need to complete the entirety of the story. \n",

      "\r\n",
      "Pros\r\n",
      "There are really no glaring flaws with the show. The plot was engaging for the first third and decent for the the rest. All the major characters have interesting traits and backgrounds. The art style is unique, and the animation is solid for the most part. The OST is pretty good.\n",

      "Cons\r\n",
      "Even though the show has no low points, there are really no real high points ever. It's kinda of just a flatline for a majority of it. If someone were to ask me \"What's your favorite part of FMAB?\", I'd literally say nothing. Everything is serviceable. It checked off all the marks for the most crowd pleasing show. It is a longish shounen show, but I don't think that's really an excuse. HxH isn't my favorite show of all time or even a personal favorite, but at least I can say I really enjoyed some of the fights and a few characters. In FMAB, I can't say that. I would assume many people would respond, \"What do you mean? I loved everything about FMAB! Everything about that show is perfect!\" But after like ep 20 or something, I just wanted it to end. The main antagonist is kinda dull, the fight scenes are ok, the themes are fairly generic, the comedy is just there for the sake of comedic relief and not actually funny, and in general, everything is kinda just there.\n",

      "To re-clarify, this show is definitely not bad. But does something with no flaws immediately make it a masterpiece? Definitely not. I'm sure if you're actually reading this and debating whether to watch FMAB, you'll might just watch it out of curiosity like I did. And if you love it to death, then great! But for me, it was just an ok and ultimately forgettable show.\n",
      "The original Fullmetal Alchemist anime was one of the first anime series I ever watched. I remember seeing glimpses of it when I was younger, but the story did not pull me in or appeal to me as much as Inuyasha did at the time. It was years later, when I was thirteen, that I finally did watch it and I fell in love. However, at the time, I didn't have much to compare it to, having never read the manga. When I heard that Brotherhood was coming out, I rushed off to read the manga and got up-to-date with it before Brotherhood started and\n",

      "Two years after these have both ended, I have re-watched the series several times, and every time I rewatch it, it never loses any appeal nor do I ever find any serious faults with it. It's a wonderful story of love and loss, pain and grief, family and friendship and put together, it makes for a very touching and compelling story about two brothers who attempt to make the best of a situation they brought on themselves by performing human transmutation as well as regain what they have lost as a result. Coupled with a wide variety of characters, all amazing in their own way, it makes for a truly amazing tale that can have you laughing one moment and crying the next. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I've read many conflicting views on both series; some say there was little to no character development in Brotherhood as compared to the original, others say Brotherhood moved too fast and wasn't as a deep of a story. I personally prefer Brotherhood to the original and here is why:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Edward Elric seems a lot more grown up in Brotherhood. In the original (now that I've seen Brotherhood and can compare the two), he is a bit whiny and annoying. My personal favorite character is the homunculus Envy, as disliked of a character he is, I believe he is a much deeper and well-developed character than he is given credit for in both series. Brotherhood's storyline seems much more thought-out and in the end, it has a much deeper message than the original. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first few episodes of Brotherhood are covering what happened in the original up to the point where it diverged from the manga and while it is rushed, I was okay with it because I wouldn't want to sit through ~30 episodes of stuff I have already seen. I feel that even though it was rushed, it got the story across just as effectively, not to mention it left more room for the plot to unfold and progress at a more natural pace. I also think the animation is lot better and more appealing to look at. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story has a great ending whereas with the original, you had to watch the movie Conqueror of Shamballa to get some real closure. I do believe that some characters in Brotherhood were killed off too soon and could have received more character development - a particular homunculus being a prime example, if you've seen the anime already I'm pretty sure you'll know who but I'm trying not to be spoilery.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in the end, I wholeheartedly believe Brotherhood far surpasses the original and the original hardly even compares. I recommend that everyone watches both, but don't be surprised if you end up preferring Brotherhood.\n",
      "This is probably an actual enjoyable anime in a way the story was pretty alright kind of mediocre compared to my expectations the only solution to which it may be able to reach the requirements of my expectations is if they added a little bit more unpredicatbility some plot twists and thickening and then it will probably reach atleast a 5. The animation was pretty poor only 1 good fight and the art as was not my cup of tea. The characters are not hot at all and sometimes kind of stupid. The sound design is basic and bland too and the overall anime was\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "below mid. Very overrated\n",

      "The story is fantastic leaving you wanting to see more. It also doesn't give too much away too quickly leaving the viewer excited to find out what will happen next.

There just wasn't a single character I found truly annoying. Edward has become my favorite anime character. The music is really good, although I did miss Tsuisou (Kyoudai/Bratja) from FMA. I loved FMA too, but thought that the story became a little random towards the end. I never had this feeling with Brotherhood, because everything I didn't\n",

      "This is the premise of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I feel that I should take the time right now to establish a few key points about this review. Brotherhood's English dub has not been fully released yet, and I do not generally enjoy watching a series in Japanese for various reasons. That said, while I did watch the latter half of Brotherhood in Japanese, I won't comment on the Japanese voice actors; I do not understand the language enough to truly grasp the emotion and meaning set behind actual words, and the only thing I have to go off of is the fansub group's interpretation of what characters were saying.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about Brotherhood. The plot of the show spans so many characters that it's a testament to the ability of the writers that they were able to keep consistency throughout the astounding and wonderful plot.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The show takes place in a fictional nation called Amestris, a place fully realized from top to bottom. Every territory's similarities to one another, and their differences, are intricately designed, and conveyed through actions, visuals, and dialogue, without ever being explicitly stated or exposited. But not just Amestris; at least two other nations are given screen time, and even one nation we never actually see, are conveyed as so different from Amestris, and yet it's clear that they're all in the same world.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Setting is great, but the characters are what make Brotherhood truly shine. I could go on about each of them individually, probably for hours on end. Each and every supporting character has their own story told, without ever dragging or detracting from the main plot of the series. Everything is woven together seamlessly, from beginning to end. The viewer is in the dark for most of the villain's plans and doings for most of the series, but by the end, it all makes perfect sense, and again, this is achieved without ever having the villains simply go on a ten minute monologue explaining everything.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every minute of the series is spent developing characters, advancing the plot, and showing the audience what they should know when they should know it, all at the same time. Even the slowest parts of the series are kept fascinating throughout.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The English dub is being produced by FUNimation, with most of the VAs from the original Full Metal Alchemist series reprising their roles. At the time of writing this review, the English dub is not yet complete, and there are still some characters yet to be voiced, but from the first thirty-nine episodes, unless everyone absolutely drops the ball for the latter half of the show, I am confident in saying that the dub is fantastic. Every character is brought to life through a combination of excellent writing and acting, and it's difficult to tell which of the two is doing more to make them believable.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mood and tone are very important in that as well. From all the praise I've been giving the series so far, it should come as no surprise that the soundtrack is beautifully composed and employed exquisitely.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything I've mentioned so far has been fantastic. So what about the low points of the series? What's done poorly? Nothing at all. Every plot thread culminates into something spectacular, no character is forgotten, and everything else is simply amazing. The only real criticism I could think of for the series is that \"science\" basically means \"magic,\" but even that doesn't detract from the series being astounding.\n",

Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\n",

There's Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There's Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime's most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening's singer. Plotwise, there isn't a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.\n",

      "Like I've already said in some of my other review, I'm not at my best, when I'm reviewing something, that I like... or love, for that matter! Maybe because, when you usually review something you love, you tend to overhype it, drooling all over it, like a rapid dog, and when someone, like me, tends to take that overhyping for granted, it can really, really easily backfire. To me, it's just so much more easier to say, why I hate something, rathen than why I love, but if I have to tell, why I love something, it's usually just something like \"meh... because!\" Not very\n",

      "The story - in a nutshell, because there's a lot! - is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse, who study alchemy, since their deadbeat-father left them out of nowhere, without mentioning when or never to return. Their mother dies, so logically, they try to bring her back... which would be all and good, if it wasn't such a taboo! So big of a taboo in fact, that the older brother looses his arm and a leg, and the other his entire body - symbolism, everywhere! With no other choise left but to \"stand up and go further\", they burn down their house, join in the military, and start their hunt in search of a legendary Philosophers stone, that can in any hands do pretty much anything, even beyond the laws of nature, equivalent exchange, or even the God himself! All in the same time, when the military and the mysterious group of renegades called Homunculi plot their way up in the circles, all waiting the Promised Day to arrive, and end the world as they know it! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What is the secret behind the Philosopher's stone, and the Isvalan civil war? What is this Promised Day, and what it means to be called a \"sacrivice\"? Who plots against who and who stands to gain immortality? All this and more, in about 60-episodes- long rollercoaster of deceat, vengeance, and hope for a happy ending!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I first saw this anime, I've already seen the \"original\" older version, and didn't like it... as much! I thought it was clumsy, little jumpy with the story department, and the characters... well, they were there. That's all. Nothing really solid there, but I won't complain. Overall, I wasn't that hyped, to see this newer, bigger and more costly \"remake\", that's supposed to follow the original manga much more loyally... and knowing, what the remakes usually do to our beloved movies, this could've been really big hit or miss! Lucky for me... I really loved it! The story really was great, with deeper themes, following so many sidestories, characters' backstories and motivations, that I actually felt like drowning into everyhting, that I was exposed to... and this anime is only about 60 episodes long! God damn!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I was so impressed about this anime, whas that it actually was relatively deep, both for a story, and the characters, and do I even dare to say... somewhat complex at a times - it took me actually three rewaches to get a good grip of the sidestories, main plot, and motivations, understandin fully every single character, and what they're \"mind-frames\" really were! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "That being said, the plot itself is still relatively simple, but the way it's told, is not! There are so many elements, and plotpoints, that it's almost hard to tell, where the actual story is, and when do all these little pieces get put together - like a awesome 3D-puzzle! But, when it does get put together, it's just so satisfactory, that it feels like... well, it feels! Questions about live and death, teology and humans' real place in the world, what you can wish for, and what you can actually have, without breaking the boundaries you're not granted to brake, what's the true price of desires, and is there really some things in this world, that should stay forbidden, untainted by humans greedy hands? These are just a scrach on the surface of many, many themes this anime has to offer, and I can't wait, to find out even more!\n",

      "The art... while still not my strongest forte in my judgement-stand-point, is still pretty impressive, and pretty to look at. The backgrounds are clear and simple, yet immaginative enough to belong into this steam-punk- ish, so-so historic version of Germany in WWII, which really was a big selling-point for me, who just absolutely loves history.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are all simple, yet easy too tell apart. They don't all have the same faces, nor all-too-similar facial expressions, which seems to be my new pet peeve in anime in regular. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fights - yes, there's fighting involved in this anime... surprise! - are very detailed and the animation compiments beautifully each characters own personalities, abilities and what are their strongest points. For example, Ed is pretty talented fighter in general, but tends to \"overheat\" if being called \"shortie\". Al is much more composed, but too gentle most of the times. The homunculi are my absolute favourite to watch, since they all have different abilites, and they all use them with precise, and with deadly talent, that's just a bliss to look at!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are still easily seen some brief, yet noticeable moments of changed animation styles, expecially during fighting. The movements tend to lack the same fluidity as it normally has, and be thus overly exaggerated, but those are just a very brief moments here and there, mostly in the second half of the series, so it gets a pass from me.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The characters - and o'boy there are tons! - aren't just some easy stereotypes, or shallow cardboard cut-outs, with little to no personality, or no actual motivations. These are real people, with real desires, flaws and sins to bear, with deep emotions and motivations, both in good and in bad. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the best part is, that it's not just the story, that gets to know them, but also we, who get to hear their thoughts, their memories and ambitions in life, like if they're talking with us, and I just love, when characters do that! You see their backstories, you hear their thoughts, their reasonings for their actions, and their points of views about situations, siding either with them, or against them. None of them are crystal clear, or pure white, and often times, I felt like watching actual real-life people, dealing with their pasts, sins, desires and flaws, rather than some fictional characters, bound in some unexplained contraption of plotpoints and events. They took their time to talk to me, to show me sides of themselves that I didn't know of, or didn't really want to learn of... but that's human for you - we all have sides in ourselves, that are both beautiful, and ugly, because we have something, called dimensions! These characters know both their own, and each others flaws, strenghts, ambitions and sins, therefore acting like a real individuals, being either hero, or a villain! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And since we're already in the subject, I may as well say a thing or two about the... romances, in this anime. Yes, there're romances in this anime, and they're actually good ones! Romance in general, has never been that one ship that holds that much water in shounen... or, in anything even slightly japanese in that matter... but when it comes to FMA:B, the romance-angle is actually pretty good... even enjoyable! And I'm not even talking about the \"sappy/sugary/over-the-top\"- romance either! I'm talking about the bonds between friends, loyalty between the master and the servants, and love between brothers, what's actually the main force of the story itself. The ever-so-subtle \"loyal-admiration\"- angle with Hawkeye and Mustang was truly memorable, same as the friendship between Musty and Huges, as well as the romance between Ed and Winry, that blooms and developes the same way as the characters grow and develope. Nothing is rushed or paisted on top to look more pretty to the eyes of the viewer. It's all very well done, in the sence that it's not so over the top -they never say that they love each other, but you can still feel and see that they do! \n",
      "\r\n",
      "And what about the villains then? My all time favourite thriving force of any media or story-telling, that keeps me - if done right! - at the edge of my seat, begging for more and... well, let's leave it to that, shall we! The villains in this pick are also very enjoyable and well made, although the show itself do suffers that glorious \"too many characters at the same time!\"- syndrome, so that not so many chracters get their time of the day to really shine and develope as the rest of the main cast does, but the thing is, that not all of them truly even need to develope - Gluttony or Sloth, although nice in general, not really that interesting to look at. Those who do get their time in the spotlight - Kimbley, Scar, some of the Homunculi and Father, for example - do get their own backstory, motivations and their own little arcs to fulfill, some of them even growing and developing along the way. It's truly a treat to look at, and therefore I wouldn't have said a bad word if the show itself was actually... say, ten episodes longer than it was, but oh well... never please the fans - they're the worst!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kudos for the sublety though, since every single detail, action and mistake counts to something, developing both story and the characters, giving them even more motivation, and depth, through both stakes, and consequenses - when someone dies, they stay there... for good!\n",

The story, although actually relatively simple, is really so heavily and tightly packed with themes, philosophy, subplots and multi-colored characters with each of their own motivations and stories, that it's really easy to get lost in the middle of it all, and loose interest as a whole - good memory, and good attention span are needed! \n",

      "Those, who enjoy investing themselves into a deep, rather long and character/plot-driven story, that forces you to think on your own and play that \"puzzle inside your brain\"- game, can indeed find this anime rather interesting, maybe even marvelous, but do bear in mind, that there's some boobs here and there, and some of the asses are being slapped for the fun of it, so if that puts you off, then better either steel yourself, or look away - it is the military, after all! \n",

The musics are amazing, and the art isn't that bad either, so if you're interested to give it a go, go for it, and enjoy the ride!\n",

From the characters of \"Father\" to \"Von Hohenheim\" they have their own goals and make their way toward it.

This anime, much like another anime called \"Monster\" (Check it out) are considered \"epics\" to me. They have a large cast, we see each character more than once, they go through a variety of different settings, have important themes and have great villians, in which sometimes you feel for the villians themselves (Envy).

      "\r\n",
      "The pacing of Brotherhood started off a bit iffy. In the first ten or so episodes, I felt it being a bit episodic. I mean, sure the first arc was about them uncovering the first batch of hard truths about what really was happening, but to me it felt just a little too episodic. Once it got around episode 11, I think that’s really when the show found its ground floor and it was uphill from there on.\n",

      "When everything was laid out for us and we were slowly fed what the over-reaching plot was, I couldn’t help but find myself so hooked to the screen episode after episode. Each one just pulled me in closer and closer, made me feel for these characters, made me want to know what was happening next, all the while not wanting to miss a single minute.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometimes anime can either bring better art styles to an adaptation than the manga ever did or it could be worse. In Brotherhood’s case, I think it fell somewhere in the middle of all of that. Bones really did do a great job capturing the essence of the art style of Brotherhood while also throwing in their own specific style. From how it all flowed in animation to how all of the fights were so brilliantly created. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I admit, I only watched the dub, so I can’t compare to how the English dub did as compared to the original subs, but I will say this: Funimation never fails to deliver on a great English dub. All around, the dub had a great cast. I don’t think no single voice actor or actress failed at what role they were given. A few standouts were: James Douglas(Major Miles), Vic Mignonga(Edward Elric), Kent Williams(Father), J. Michael Tatum(Scar), and Colleen Clickenbeard(Hawkeye).  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the sound effects and soundtrack, I think everything fit well. They timed the right moments with the right tracks.

I specifically loved the second OP and EP.\n",

      "Now to the characters. Such a large, yet wonderful cast of characters. Of course, thorugh it all, Ed and Al are the main focus through the first half. Then, that were we got to know the other characters at least in some bits. I really liked how each main character had their own arc and were given time to develop and grow in their own way. For example, I loved how Scar was able to grow in a way that made sense for him. I also liked how Greed kept on swaying from good to bad. I really felt for him.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One standout character through this all was Roy. I loved how his constant arc of the show was a combination of two things: Becoming fuehrer of the country and avenging Hughes. Throughout the entire ordeal of everything going around him, those two main objectives kept his character the most interesting, I think, especially the dark path he took for a few episodes. That really brought the realism of this show full circle and how one decision could set us down the wrong path.\n",

      "Of course a well written story isn't much if the characters in it aren't also well written. Fortunately the characters in this show are all memorable and interesting, in many different aspects. Something at this show does especially well is villains. Each of the main villains are all so different and intimidating in their own ways. While one villain's size is terrifying, as a contrast another one is just as, if not more, intimidating by simply being in a room with the main protagonists. The overall antagonist in this series is one of my favorites in all of anime. The intelligence, the power, the mystery, this is an all around great main villain. The heroes in this series are also very well written. The development of some takes over half the show to be even close to be complete, and it all pays off to create amazing co-stars. Taking a look at the main protagonists, the Elric Brothers, these are easily two of the best siblings in anime as well as other genres of television. There is a very strong and believable family relationship between them in many more ways than one. One character that outdoes the two brothers in terms of being well written is none other than their own father, Hohenhiem. Just saying one thing about his past would soil his character arc. Overall each character is original and believable in their own way, staying away from repetitious arcs such as \"someone died, now I'm evil\" with one exception, which is developed and improved dramatically. Everyone has a drive, some simple, some complex, but all of them well done.\n",

The characters all have different looks and clothing making them easily distinguishable. There are however occasional quality drops but towards the end of the series these are very scarce. Music is also a very nice tone setting element with each song sounding like an orchestral piece. Some of these songs do get repeated quite a few times but if you're watching the show for your first time I can't see it being too noticeable or annoying. Many of the sound effects fit very well with situations and often give scenes that extra push, weather it be dramatic or silly. The official Funimation dub of this show is one of their best in my opinions. If you don't enjoy dubs, that's fine, but I suggest if you do try only one, try this one.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flaws of this series often resolve themselves over time. The true momentum of this show, where I found myself not wanting the episodes to end, was about episode 25. That's not to say anything before that isn't as good, that's just the point where I began to watch until I could barely hold my eyes open. I would love to give this show a perfect ten, but I will say it has it's flaws, few they may be. This is my favorite anime of all and I strongly suggest it to anyone who likes mystery, strong characters, and great fight scenes.\n",

      "There are just some series that when over you say “this was a great anime.” Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is that kind of series. There are times when remakes just don’t work (like the remake for the PSX game Wild Arms), but this is a remake that does pretty much everything right and as a total package is a great series. The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a good series that many enjoyed. Of course the ending and subsequent movie rubbed me the wrong way. But, I don’t think anyone can say it was a bad decision to go back and remake the series following the original\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "manga to the finish. The problem for the first Fullmetal Alchemist was that it started back in 2003. For those who didn’t know the manga finished alongside Brotherhood which ended in 2010. That is a lot of material that the original series could never cover. The only options available to Fullmetal Alchemist was doing an original story or stopping and waiting. Regardless of how that decision turned out that left a lot of material untouched and thus more than enough reason to do a remake. Of course if there is one thing I’m glad they remade the series for it was the EdxWinry relationship. The thing that didn’t really even happen in the original series with how it ended. This time it was done right and you are left smiling at the end.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course the story wasn’t simply about these two brothers. At the core of it was Hohenheim, who was so critical to events. They condensed his history into an episode, but one can imagine the kind of life he had to lead. You could really feel sympathy for all the suffering he endured, but by the end he was proud of the life he lead.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It can just continue on with characters like Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar, Greed, Ling Yao, May Chang, etc. In terms of characters Brotherhood gets an A+ if I could since there were so many good ones that anyone who watches the series could have different top 5s. In terms of action a lot of characters outside the main leads got serious battles. Characters from Mustang to Ling had some great fights that are easy to remember even after the series has ended. In terms of serious battles it wasn’t like the leads did all the work at all. The best fights in the series probably would go to Mustang and Wrath. They received so many GAR moments it’s hard to believe. I liked how many of the characters really had their motivations tapped into so we could understand where they were coming from. Mustang had the desire to change the country and protect everyone while the powerful motivation to avenge Hughes also drove him on. Ling and May had the future of their respective clans on the line in the battle to curry favour with the Emperor of Xing and become Emperor or Empress. Everyone had things that were driving them forward and the main characters were just part of the whole thing. It’s not like you didn’t care about the leads since they were well developed, but you could care about other characters and no one would fault you.\n",
      "Now this is what I would call an Anime! Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has everything a viewer could ask for; action, adventure, suspense, thrill, humor, character, a splash of romance, and of course, fun. Not only that but this magnificent Anime includes scientific background; chemistry, to be specific. Could anyone actually believe that a Shonen Anime could have such depth? I couldn't, but Brotherhood kicked that belief's ass and put in a whole new genre of \"Shonen Anime\" in replacement.\n",

      "The series is primarily dealing with the two adolescents: Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric. Starting off a bit slow, the series brings to you their past events\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "and also current events that leads to their status' as human beings. To be quite honest they have pretty much hit rock bottom, having committed taboo; loosing parts of their bodies, Alphonse's whole body; no parents...my lord, it's just to much to handle. The series shows these events in a unique, if I may say in a 'Spicy' manner. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though having a troublesome life, the Elric Brothers are near supreme in a technique called Alchemy (the reconstructing of chemicals into any specific shape or form). Most alchemists have to use a \"transmutation circle\" to use any form of reconstruction, yet the Edward can use alchemy with out the use of such. This brings him his name \"Fullmetal Alchemist.\" \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aside from the basics the plot is pretty much a rollercoaster, it changes all the time because of events that take place in the series. This is what I thought was so unique to Brotherhood compared to any other series. Interchanging plots are hard to come by, it puts enjoyment to a whole new level.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Referring to anymore of the story would just spoil what this series becomes. But what I can say is this alternating plot brings in the exquisite fun that the characters get to handle. New characters get brought in, characters change sides, even characters that have no damn idea what they are doing. This has a huge impact on the viewer, you will never know who to like. Honestly, it's a ton of fun.\n",

      "Now for the artsy side of the series. The music is definitely well composed, Akira Senju really out did himself this time. Every piece is used as fluently as possible, it'll be something new viewers should look forward too. The animation...okay, well this probably the only downer. Sorry to tell you, but the art just isn't the best. A little goofy looking at time, sometime the hair doesn't fully suit where the place of the head is, just a lot of stuff. But it isn't dreadful! It's honestly good for what it is and it is based on the way Hiromu Arakawa drew the manga. For the initial art not being at its finest, the actions and motions are eloquently done, no doubts there.\n",

And if you're not, that is your own opinion. But anyway, I hope all you viewers take this Anime in consideration, Thank you for reading!\n",
      "Overall this probably is the best anime ever created. Is it perfect? NO. Is it my favorite? NO. But it is overall very enjoyable for just about everybody. That is the strength of this show; it caters to just about everybody. There are some very funny moments and those are balanced out by some very dark and serious moments. There is plenty of intense action that is quite literally non-stop, and quite frankly it makes DBZ looking boring. The soundtrack for this show is probably my all time favorite for any anime, and I have some the songs on my I-Pod. The plot is very\n",

For 64 episodes long, I have never seen so many well flushed-out characters, but this anime achieves that no problem. The English Voice Dub is by far the best dub I have ever heard, and the voice for King Bradley is in a class of its own. I would recommend this to literally anybody, but especially those who like to see incredibly detailed and creative fight scenes. \n",

      "Overall: 9.5/10\r\n",
      "This show really should be viewed as a masterpiece due to the fact the story never goes off on any tangents that are unrelated to the plot. It sticks true to its guns and never lets up. The final scene involving the main villain achieving \"GOD\" is probably the coolest thing I have seen in anime, and it really makes the show more interesting overall. I would recommend this show to anybody. It's amazing, but not quite perfect.\n",
      "This is a very easy review. This show does not hold up on its own in anyway shape or form. It literally requires you to have read the manga or seen the previous anime. The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it. Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it. It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe. The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly to people who claim \"BEST EVER\" because\n",

There are almost no fillers and the plot will blow you away, at first I didn't want to watch this but I eventually gave it a chance, and after 2 episodes I was completely hooked and took every chance I could to watch it. It's one of the greatest anime I've ever seen!\n",
      "For a while I was very hesitant to watch FMA:Brotherhood. From what I had seen it seemed like a show that was based around humor and seemed like it wouldn't really go anywhere. Don't me get wrong, I love comedy, I just hate it when that's all the anime is about.That being said, brotherhood is hilarious at times, I often found myself laughing while watching it. I eventually decided to watch brotherhood, because I figured I should give it a shot. It has made it's way into my top 5 list and is one of the best animes out there.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story- The story is explained fairly\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "well in the synopsis so there isn't much I can really say, but here is a small explanation of it from my point of view. So you have these two brothers who got into alchemy at a young age. They end up losing their mother and they try to bring back her back through alchemy (which is a taboo) but to no avail. In the process Edward Elric loses his leg and his brother Alphonse his entire body, in a worried attempt Edward sacrifices his right arm in order to bind his brothers soul into a suit of armor. The whole story is about their adventures to find a philosophers stone so they can use it's power and get their bodies back. With it being a long anime and having a fairly straight-forward goal in mind you would figure it would have some filler right? Absolutely wrong, there is not one episode of filler in brotherhood, that is what I like most about it. It's a long anime that has no filler! It has done what seems to be impossible to me. On-top of it having no filler, and having non-stop action every single episode, it actually isn't all comedy based like I had previously thought. It actually has a very dark side to it and it caught me off-guard within the first few episodes. A few scenes in particular have stuck with me and still make me depressed or have given me angst when I think about it. Not to sat that it doesn't have comedy in it, it's actually one of the funniest animes I have watched, but the comedy feels good in it and doesn't feel out of place like some anime I have watched.  It has a ton of plot twists that you don't actually see coming and gives you a ton of back-story so you actually feel like you know these characters, not  just the main characters either, you really get to know some of the side characters. They don't feel like they where just there, they all have depth and feel important to the story, and if something happens to them you actually get worried about them and care what happens. It had an extremely good ending and I had only 1 complaint about the whole story. I don't want to spoil anything, but lets just say the ending was \"missing something\". It was nothing critical to the main story, but if they had added a little more at the ending and emphasized on a few things it would have made it that much better.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art- The animation and art are really well done. It had some rather creepy and eerie feeling artwork in it, which really set the mood. Nothing much to really say, it was top notch animation and artwork.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound-It has a various number of openings and endings, all of which I really liked and enjoyed. Brotherhood has one of the best English dubs in existence, they voice acting is extremely well done and I couldn't imagine watching it any other way.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character- Brotherhood has a really amazing cast of characters, a rather huge cast of characters that actually have a ton of depth to them and feel important. The two main characters Edward and Alphonse are just awesome people. Edward has a height complex, which he gets made fun of alot and I find it just hilarious. Then you have Alphonse who is just a badass and wants to just get back to his original body. Some of the side characters I really like are Winry, who is a child hood friend of Edward and Alphonse, Louis Armstrong, who is just a monster of a man who flaunts his muscles every chance he gets and gets beat up on by his sister(which is hilarious), ling, who is a foreigner who is actually quite badass, and last but not least is colonel mustang, who is arguably the strongest alchemist with his fire alchemy. My point being is that the entire cast is just awesome and very well made.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment- There was never a dull moment with this anime, whether it was one of the amazing fight scenes going on, something tragic happening, a crazy plot-twist, or just something hilarious, there was always something entertaining happening. You would have to be a really boring person not be able to get some sort of entertainment from this.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall- Overall this is really a masterpiece of an anime. I judge anime very harshly and it made it's way to my top 5 list, so if that doesn't something I don't know what does. It is a very enjoyable anime that ANY otaku should watch. I really can't properly explain how awesome this is, just go and watch it and you will understand, just make sure you watch the dub, because it is a really well done dub.\n",

      "I probably have more to say, but here's a brief summary, sorry if this pisses off any fanboys.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The good:\r\n",
      "It's beautifully animated, and the music is incredible. While I got tired of the little animation gags they did, the fights were so good it made up for it entirely. The score, like I said, was amazing, really loved it. Also there are some good characters and solid episodes. \n",
      "\n",
      "...\n",
      "The bad:\r\n",
      "First, it's kind of boring. I honestly just didn't really get engaged in the show until part 4, then it immediately got boring again. The only episodes I was really engaged in was the Ling, Wrath, and Hohenheim episodes, and those were few and far between. \r\n",
      "This brings me to my second issue, the characters. Personally, Ed and Al are some of my least favorite protagonists of all time. I'll try not to get into too many spoilers but they pretty quickly run out of motivation once the truth of the philosopher's stone was revealed, so then they story controls them rather than the other way around. This is really important especially in the ending, when it's revealed that the fight they think they're fighting has been going on for literal thousands of years and Hohenheim already has many contingencies in place. Other characters like Scar and Kimblee are also super cool, but totally wasted as they don't end up mattering AT ALL in the larger story.\r\n",
      "Finally, I don't understand the universe. They claim it's all about equivalent exchange, but it's never explained how characters can just make stuff, like Mustang can just make fire, or Scar can just destroy stuff. Even if you can explain that, why are there even different types of Alchemy, why does flame alchemy exist, and if it does, why can't Edward do it. Other than not needing a circle, is Edward actually special? I was just constantly confused by the power system and different types of alchemy, despite them all being the same. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, it's okay. I like some of the characters (Ling, Greed, Wrath), and again the animation alone maybe makes it worth watching. However, the story and the protagonists just didn't do it for me. I know it technically reaches into deeper themes of truth and loss and whatever, but like I said, it reaches. The story isn't good enough to actually be deep, it just feels like it's trying too hard and not actually making a story worth watching.\n",
      "I can not understand how the frick this show is number 1 on mal and has a score of 9.22 of the time of writing this because it sure as frick does not deserve that rating. The story is typical, a protagonist has a goal that is bound to be fulfilled by the end. People say the wordbuilding is brilliant but compared to most animes out now it isnt really that big of a deal. Storywise, it can go more into depth with its story and world but just doesn't. It isn't the worst though since it can be interesting sometimes. The art isn't because\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "of the source material but the anime production staff itself. I don't have a problem with it and i actually find the animation quite apealing. Some viewing positions can make a scene feel more tense and eerie which i really like about fmab. Sound is not really too much of a problem execpt for the fact that the op 1 is the only good op, other than that sound is pretty average. I really don't like a lot of the characters especially alphonse and may. Those 2 never cease to piss me off throughout the show. The sound of alphonse's voice makes me want to choke on a rusty nail and may is just just such a useless and annoying character and the panda god i just wanted it to die already. Other than that the characters weren't the worst and some like Roy actually surpassed my expectations. I didn't hate fmab but i also didn't like it. I was slightly intrigued while being bored at the same time. This anime was not memorable to me whatsoever and was very forgettable. That saying it was not the worst iv'e ever seen and there are defiently better like Hunter and Berserk. In conclusion i wish this show was not ranked 1 because it doesn't deserve to be while Hunter X Hunter does.\n",
      "Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood was on my list for a while and since Funi was losing their streaming rights to the series I thought I take my opportunity to binge watch it.

The story makes you think the main villain is person A, but then makes you think it's person B just to make you think it's person C only to finally reveal who the real villain is (character names redacted to prevent spoilers).

      "in a world where the primary form of warfare is through alchemy, the science of deconstructing and reconstructing matter. The presiding law of alchemy, known as the 'Law of Equivalent Exchange', states that humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. \n",

      "I won't provide a summary of the anime, as that's already provided. So let me instead say that the storyline of FMAB is--in a word--genius. There's no other way to describe it. There are so many intricate plot twists that just cannot be predicted. This anime starts as simply the Elric brothers' quest to restore their bodies. But it turns into SO much more. As the Elric brothers meet new people--and lose many of them--they realize there is a large underground conspiracy at work in Amestris. Suddenly they are pulled into something much greater than their mission, and they find themselves working to save not only their loved ones, but their country and the entire world. \n",

      "*KEEP IN MIND* This series is different from the 2003 anime known as \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". The first 10 or so episodes of FMA adhered to the original plot of the manga, and then the anime series diverged because the manga had not been completed. Personally, I hated the diverged plot. It simply did not seem logical. The ending of the series was terrible, and the follow-up movie, \"The Conqueror of Shamballa\", was also awful. I felt the 2003 anime and movie did not do full justice to the original Fullmetal Alchemist story. \n",

      "Needless to say, the art of this anime is a 10. Arakawa-san (the mangaka of this series) puts great detail into the city of Amestris, the military uniforms of Central Command and Briggs, and every other tiny detail all the way to the last screw in Edward's automail arm and leg. And then there are the transmutation circles!! These were constructed so intricately, I have such unfathomable respect for Arakawa-san for all the work she put into designing these. The art is genius. It enhances the plot and characters even more--if that's even possible--and couldn't better suit the feel of this series. \n",

Tunes like \"Far East Suite\" depict relaxation; \"Overture ~Brotherhood~\" is beautifully reminiscent; \"Xing Symphony (Overture)\" is the perfect music for any battle scene; and don't even get me started on the intensity and tragedy of \"Lapis Philosophorum.\" I don't think even Beethoven could have done it better. I have the highest respect for Akira Senju, the FMAB OST composer. The music doesn't distract, but it certainly intensifies every single scene, forcing the viewers to make the characters' emotions their own.\n",

Edward is your typical strong-willed pig-headed protagonist with an unbelievably tragic past and an ironically huge complex about his height. Alphonse is the more mild-mannered brother, the voice of reason in the relationship between the two of them. Together, they are unstoppable. Their closeness is admirable. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there are other characters besides the beloved Elric brothers. There's Winry, Pinako, Scar, Ling, Lan Fan, and Fu. There are the heroes of Central Command, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, Heymans Breda, Maria Ross, Kain Fuery, and Black Hayate. And then there are more heroes from North Command at Briggs: General Olivier Mira Armstrong, Major Miles, Captain Buccaneer, and Vato Falman. Every single character in this anime with a name has a huge purpose. Not a single person is underrepresented.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And oh, the villains of this anime! I hated them, of course, but at the same time I respected them so much. The homunculi--nearly invincible and humanlike--are named after the Seven Deadly Sins and emulate their respective sins. But the viewers always catch a glimpse of their humanity--the sadness behind the atrocities they commit, the longing behind their overconfident facades. Sometimes it's difficult to even call them villains, because Arakawa-san shows us that they're not much different from us. Can we really hate them? I have yet to figure that out myself. \n",

      "There's no emotion that FMAB hasn't evoked. I've shed laughing tears, crying tears, angry tears, frustrated tears. I've gone \"awww\" at cute moments and at death scenes. You never know what's going to happen--you can always expect the unexpected. And you can always count on Edward to diffuse a tense battle moment by tripping and falling or getting angry at someone for calling him short. I enjoyed every single moment of Brotherhood, and I would gladly do it again and again. \n",

This series has made me cry and laugh and shout at my computer and ultimately smile contentedly at its ending. (While crying, of course, because I didn't want it to end!) I can't even explain how much I love this series. I guarantee it will change your life in some way. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has surely changed my life. I will never forget its impact.

This series, however, is probably nine times better. Even seeing the original this is a completely new experience after about the first six or seven episodes. The artwork is great, not that the original was bad, but it just seems to have a slightly updated, high definition spin on the old. It also seems to add a bit more gore than the original, showing the inner workings of the fights rather than just blood squirts. I love this\n",

While FMA runs over character development, and you get to know almost every character as good as the main characters, Brotherhood fails in that. And they fail on that because Brotherhood is more story-orientated than FMA. The character development is so deep in FMA, that you feel like if an arc finishes when any secondary character dies, while in Brotherhood the death of a character just seems like an ordinary episode, the best example is Hughes, that while in FMA you get to know, and love him very much, in Brotherhood is just another death. This works just fine with Brotherhood, as you'll see when it develops ever further.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Released in 2011, Brotherhood acts as a more direct and faithful adaptation to the original manga. This was most likely done to appease the fans of the manga who didn't care much for the divergent story in the original 2003 anime. Now, as much as I liked the 2003 anime, it had quite a few\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "flaws. After they went in a separate direction from the manga, the 2003 anime took a heavy nosedive. The plot became unfocused and it ultimately felt like a small story taking place in a massive setting. A lot of plot elements didn't click correctly, Wrath was fucking obnoxious, the ending was abrupt and rushed. It wasn't quite a masterpiece, but it was still really good. Then along comes 2011's Brotherhood and as you can probably tell, I think Brotherhood is significantly better than the 2003 anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brotherhood's story was focused, logical, had heart and emotion, was well executed, gave depth to every character that needed it and some that didn't, and even addressed some of the more annoying plot issues that the original anime had (and even some that were in the manga!) Every opening and closing song is great and fits the tone of the current arc, and personally my favorites were \"Again\" by Yui, and \"Let It Out\" by Miho Fukuhara. The soundtrack is unbelievable and carries a very emotional tone to the visuals, which are nothing short of great.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The great visual direction of the 2003 anime carries over to Brotherhood, with for the most part improvements in animation. The original's art style was a bit bland and dated poorly, but Brotherhood has a more timeless and comforting look to it that sets it apart. The only real problem I have it Envy. Envy's 3-dimensional animation for his true form is nothing short of unsightly. Putting 3D animation in a show like this is fine, so long as you don't do it once. That's because it will stick out horribly and look completely unnatural. Sure enough, it looks completely unnatural and ugly. Still though, nearly flawless. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As far as characters go, Brotherhood once again shines. Every character, even the \"evil\"* characters, are somewhat relate-able, understandable, and/or likable. I put an asterisk next to evil because Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of those clever little shows that knows that there is no such thing as good or evil. Every character's motivations and actions are clearly presented outside the childish realms of good and evil, so that every event feels real and the result of true human conflict. What would be a mustache twirler in any other show is a complex character with interesting traits and understandable motivations in Brotherhood.  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I consider to be Brotherhood's greatest strength is its heart and emotion. I mean no hyperbole when I say I cried for the entire last 2 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Seeing every arc come together flawlessly and bring the anime to a close was absolutely beautiful, and it wasn't just the characters that held such powerful emotional weight. I was crying partially because I didn't want it to be over. It was too perfect and I couldn't believe it was over because I was enjoying it too much. I should say too that the list of things that have made me cry is a pretty short. It consists of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Pay It Forward, (some movie I can't remember at the minute), and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. So to say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood carries emotional weight is a massive understatement, as it is not only intelligent, but made with real heart and it shows.\n",

      "I don't give 10s out very often in any format, but Brotherhood most certainly has earned its mark. While the 2003 anime was very good and still outshines most other shonen, Brotherhood feels like the Fullmetal Alchemist series is just taking a victory lap. It's so good that it's practically unfair to even label it a shonen. It can appeal to anyone and everyone, and in my opinion, is virtually flawless.\n",

      "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the most critically acclaimed anime loved by both connoisseurs and casuals.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let me start with the very first mentionable point to notice, which is a negative one. This anime expects its viewers to be already well acquainted with the franchise before watching it. So, the introduction is pretty straight forward and awkwardly so. I get that it has its alternative version or a manga with proper introduction. But, that's not Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and people would definitely not like to read the manga or another anime with 51 episodes before watching a 64 episodes anime just for a proper introduction.\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "In Brotherhood, at the beginning, you see the characters doing whatever they do without you knowing what it is that they're doing, or even saying. \"Oh so he's the Fullmetal Alchemist!? Whatever the hell is a Fullmetal Alchemist anyway?\" So, yeah.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite being awkward at the beginning, there is something that still makes it perceivable. You don't know the details, but you have a vague idea that something is actually happening, so the viewers are tempted to watch further to know what exactly was it as there were many flashy things going on and it felt like there was some meaning to it. It's a cheap trick to hook the viewers, but it worked. That's what saves it from being dropped at the very beginning, but the fact that it's awkward still remains. This is how it is for the first few episodes. After that you get rewarded for not dropping it earlier with some genius story composition. This anime's storyline considers a number of possibilities and takes the best path. Which ends up with a brilliant ending, that I consider one of the bests among happy endings. It packs up the whole series nicely, making it a complete story.\r\n",
      "The anime has an overarching and well progressing plot handled carefully. I didn't notice any bothersome inconsistency after the opening episodes. The story isn't repetitive in any way. It's story is simple but has considerable depth to it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the characters who were introduced at first had improper introduction, I as a viewer got along with them as time passed. The characters introduced later on are well presented. But, the character development in this anime is very typical and genric. Bad guys get saved by the good guys, realize that they shouldn't follow the orders of the evil bosses and help the good guys on their own will. And someone gets violent as hell who doesn't feel strong restraint when killing someone almost overnight after a harsh experience. Something we haven't ever seen? The development on the good guys isn't remarkable and sometimes nonexistent. There are however some really good character development. For example, the slow and consistent development of that greedy man I forgot the name of who used to own a mine or something that he lost due to our MC, Edward Elric and some Homunculi. What's genuinely good about this anime's characters is the screentime distribution. This is very essential in this anime in particular, partly because it has many likable characters and it'd be really disappointing if they didn't get enough screentime.\r\n",
      "The antagonism in this anime is shallow, with very weak reasons and goals to justify for all the dreadful deeds. The evil military personnel and some other bad guys are horribly one dimensional. The character interaction is decent, but could've been better. The overall cast is very well handled, nevertheless.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I liked the world building in this anime. It makes big approaches by dividing the State, having different regions with different climate, culture, general attitudes and lifestyles. It makes medium approaches by having different cities, towns, countrysides, etc with their definite geological location and connecting them with consideration of distance and cultural transition. And finally, it makes small approaches by detailing the small points in the places where the story takes place in. It's attention to tiny details like mud on the body after crossing a muddy path, or dirts after falling on the ground were mesmerizing but never preachy. The anime makes no unrealistic or unbelievable change in the already established environmental points. Basically, it did excellent job on the places it shows. But unfortunately, it doesn't show majority of its world. We only get to properly see The State of Amestris. It gives a small idea of Xing through some of its characters from that empire, but that wasn't enough to relay a good description. We don't really even know if there's any other country aside from the State of Amestris, Xerxes and the Empire of Xing. And even if it did mention other countries, it must've been very unimpressive for me to remember or even notice. In short, it doesn't quench one's thirst for the view of its world. Then again, it's a good thing that the anime doesn't go out of its way to show around the parts of the world that aren't important, consequently not drawing the attention away from the story. I'd like to inform you that it has a town based on automails as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Automails are prosthetic limbs made of metal. The technology behind this element is not much explained, but I really liked it. How they presented that there is nerve connection and the pain of that time really made me feel it. I liked how there are so many types of automails. And loved the idea of having different types of automails for different weather. Basically I loved how they didn't leave it as it is just because it's not a main element and was used for more reasons than just showing Edward's resolves.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main element, Alchemy, is an edited form of the Alchemy we know. Here, one can understand, break and reconstruct matters and that's what Alchemy here is. It's not very deep, but efficient. Aside from shooting pillars and rocks (like wtf!?), the use of Alchemy is very good. The difference in the usage of Alchemy between the West and the East is interesting. Alchemy is adequately crafted to satisfy a superficial view while also running the story, it's not enough explored to get past the highly functioning brains that like to go deep into analysis. But well, it doesn't need to be extremely deep and didn't do anything pretentious to make it deep either. The shooting pillars and rocks are still blatant though.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The power curve of this anime is very good. The MC isn't utterly overpowered. In fact, he's far outranked by many people. He trains, but doesn't become stronger than most of them which is really plausible. The overpowered villain is justified. I loved how in the end, the anime didn't pull any unnecessary, unbelievable, unreliable power up to defeat the overpowered villain.\n",

      "A bothersome point in this anime is the immortal army. FMAB does have a realism that it sticks to, but this particular point is slightly too unrealistically overdone considering its realism. It's not really much necessary either. I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have felt anything lacking if this wasn't here. The evil military personnel could've been brainwashed instead of tempted, which could've solved an aforementioned issue as well.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyway, many of the shortcomings in this anime are obtained through nitpicking and are massively outweighted by its greatness. The plot points are tied very well so there's no considerable loose end. It's overarching with its elements and plot but still very well handled. There are sufficient job done on everything. It's philosophy is simple and unpretentious. The main philosophy that for getting something, there has to be a sacrifice of equal amount is an excellent example. It also tells us to not be too conceited. There are many other teachings relayed in the anime. Truth's vague existence actually plays well here.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMAB has great animation and cinematography. The artwork of the character design is good, but how it was used was slightly problematic. Especially when you can't tell that a seemingly man is actually a woman. The reason might be that almost all the faces are designed rounded and there are little difference in male and female facial construction. Well, I'm not sure if it's because of getting used to it or the improvement of the art, but it seems perfect later on. It's probably the latter but if just in case it is the former, then the anime does great job helping the viewers to get used to it. The attire design is excellent and the colors are masterfully used while designing the characters. It has some extremely well choreographed fight scenes which are exhilarating. This anime has by far one of the best collection of opening and ending songs if not the best. All of them are great. Some are easily top list materials. The background musics are remarkable as well. Loved Lapis Philosophorum in particular.\r\n",
      "The atmosphere of this anime is not as dark as its former 2003 version and I found it more fitting. The lighthearted un-overwhelming atmosphere is a better choice here, imo.\r\n",
      "This anime is superficially perfect. It's specialty is that it has almost everything you need to learn and can ask for from an anime. And there's no way to call it \"pretentious\". Overall, it's very well put together and definitely one of the best anime I've watched so far.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a tier 1 9/10 show.\n",
      "I thought it was terrible! It’s the worst show that I have ever seen… is what I would like to say. To my surprise, FMA:B is the best shounen show that I have seen in my life (not that I have watched many other shounen series, but whatever). If I had seen this as a kid, I may have been reeled to watching anime way earlier than I did. Note that I haven’t watched the first anime adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist and I don’t think I will anytime soon.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Frankly, I was hesitant to pick up FMA since I tend to avoid shounen like the plague,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "but since I have dedicated myself to watching the more popular shows recently, I figured that this is the one that I should start with (also with a lot of persuasion power on the part of my friends).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What made me like this show? Well, for starters, It is very, very entertaining. Believe it or not, I finished watching the whole of FMA:B in just four days. I loved it that much. It had very nice fight scenes and overall aesthetic appeal. But FMA:B had something that similar shounen shows didn’t have: direction. Unlike most other shounen anime, FMA:B knows that it has a story to tell. It doesn’t waste time on things that do not contribute something to world building, character building/development or historical background. You will even find yourself amazed that “filler” episodes aren’t exactly filler.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I guess this is from the fact that the manga has already ended when Brotherhood was made, but it’s still pleasant to find a shounen anime that doesn’t troll you (hello there Bleach, Naruto and One Piece!) or make kids’ games a part of a large scale of glorified nonsense (hello there every single toy advertisement anime!).\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other than these things, FMA:B still keeps the spirit of shounen, an anime that appeals to young children, while being entertaining enough to be appreciated by the veteran anime watcher. I guess the only thing that I would nitpick about is its virtually zero rewatch value. I wouldn’t really want to watch this all over again, but hey, that’s a prime characteristic of a shounen show and I’m completely fine with that.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I’d love to tell you more about this anime, but I wouldn’t want to spoil all of the juicy parts. I say, just watch it and see for yourselves – a shounen with direction, protagonists with personality and hard-earned real power, and a very nice show to look at. I couldn’t ask any more from an anime from a genre that I don’t usually watch.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As of this writing, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of my all-time favorite shows at number 5 with my personal MAL rating of 8.\n",
      "Having watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series at a young age (the series itself came out in 2004, I believe), my twelve-year-old self was stoked when I found out that there was a reboot whilst screwing around on some anime chat room. The year was 2010. Needless to say, I ended up loving the show, even more than the original. All of my favorite characters had returned, and were just as badass as ever. But this anime needs more than a paragraph. It deserves more than that. There's a reason that people still discuss it, and the fanbase is just\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "as fervent as when the show was airing all the way across the Pacific in good old Nihon. Or the Atlantic and all of Asia... Whatever. Same thing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Story:  Without getting too deep into the FMA:B storyline, the basic premise of the show involves two brothers who, accidentally (duh), forfeit their limbs and bodies in an attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy, which also happens to be a moral taboo. They then seek to find some way of restoring their lost humanity (and pride) by setting out on a journey in search of the fabled Philosopher's Stone. The story, of course, does not end there. But what fun would it be if I spoiled anything else? Alchemist's story manages to be engaging with, quite amazingly, zero baggage, even while clocking in at beefy 64 episodes. There is a clear purpose constant throughout each episode that never gets muddled or buried by another storyline. Everyone has their motives, and these motives propel the story forward. Some people might find the first few episodes somewhat rushed, as they cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. I assume that this is because much of said material was covered in the first series, which most viewers have typically seen. The pacing eventually evens out, however, when new material is introduced. The anime's story follows the original storyline of the manga, which the original veered away from about halfway through its runtime. And, in my opinion, the manga storyline is much better. There are too many differences to cover, and doing so would mean spoilers, but I will say that the ending in Brotherhood is perfect, much better than the original's mediocre one.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art and Animation:  The show is animated by Studio BONES (Soul Eater, Space Dandy, Eureka Seven, Wolf's Rain, Darker than Black, Gosick, Ouran). Those familiar with BONES know that it, when given a good budget, can rival any other studio in production quality. As with Brotherhood, the animation is wonderful. The art is very colorful, and the characters' features stand out amongst the backdrops. The show's visual quality is superior to the original, which is expected with a higher budget. As great as the art is, it isn't jaw-dropping.                                  \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound: There's not much to talk about here. The soundtrack is perhaps a bit above average, and while it fits and benefits the show, it isn't something I would rush to purchase. The sound design (sound effects, etc.) is worth mentioning, as it brings the fast-paced alchemy battles and gunfire-laden battlefronts to life. Vic Mignogna's performance as Edward Elric in the English dub is also noteworthy.                                \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Characters:  This is the beef of the show (as with almost all good animes, imo). Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric reprise their roles as the main protagonists in Brotherhood, as well as all supporting protagonists. The villain cast, mainly comprised of mysterious apparitions named after the 7 Deadly Sins (if that doesn't make you want to watch the show, I don't know what will) returns for a second round at our heroes as well. As simple as it sounds, it's not quite so. For starters, there is a substantial amount of characters. It's not the most I've ever seen, and not all that tricky to keep track of (animes like Baccano!, for example), but viewers familiar with harem shows or other tightly-knit casts might be uncomfortable at first with the scale of Alchemist's world. But it's this scale and complexity that moves the show's pistons, all while elevating it above its competition. Not a single character is unnecessary, each one playing some form of role that completes the show. The chemistry between Ed and Al is vital not only for the show's plot, but for the emotional links necessary to keep a viewer interested in a 64 episode show. On the antagonist side, our villains possess just as much chemistry. Er, well, at least some of them... There are some characters whose presence also defies the typical good-vs-bad, and are not necessarily anti-heroes either. Their existence alone provides plenty of material, which, of course, relates back to the main plotline. None of the characters are annoying, which is perhaps the most amazing feat (most shows have at least one character that is obnoxious). Kudos to the writers on these characters. They could be the best I've ever seen.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Final Verdict:  Fullmetal Alchemist has been a huge staple in the anime world since 2004. After Brotherhood, it has become a legend. I always find it easier in hindsight to criticize shows and nitpick their flaws. As I grow older, I'm able to look back at shows that I loved as a kid and accept that they were not the pinnacle of entertainment (Dragonball series, Pokemon, etc.). Looking back at Brotherhood, however, only affirms what I thought of it as a preteen: one of the greatest series of any form of entertainment that I have ever viewed. The world of anime, as well as films, music, video games, and even politics is full of fads, things the “come and go”, as we commonly put it. Five years from now , Sword Art Online will be an obscure title that very few will remember or know about. It's been a decade since the original FMA aired in Japan, and many still discuss it. I anticipate that in the years to come, many will discuss Brotherhood, whether it's children mesmerized by the animation and color, teenagers in awe of the epic actions scenes, young adults enamored in the subtle romantic subplots, or adults impressed and intrigued with the complex chemistry between the characters.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "One problem in both long and short anime alike is often the ending. Since a lot of anime are based on manga or light novels, they are sometimes released before the source material is finished. Therefore, the anime may have that fancy \"Completed\" status, but it's actually just waiting for season 2. Which may never happen anyway, if the initial release isn't popular enough. Of course, there are also endings that are just plain bad, either leaving too much hanging or just not being well-written.\n",

      "FMA: Brotherhood, again, did not have this problem in the slightest. The ending it gave was definite, conclusive, fulfilling, and, as if the writers were answering my prayers, happy.

That's not a bad thing; on the contrary, that means it was really well-written. But I personally prefer happy endings.\n",

      "The sound and music of this show is epic and amazing, all the opening, closing themes are beautifully done and we all remember at least one of them, the sounds in the show itself helps draw you in and helps shows a characters development when someones angry, upset or happy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Character wise, every character gets development and you get attached to each and everyone of them, both the animals and the humans and it can make you smile and cry when you find out what happens. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "The enjoyment is just perfect and will want you to watch it over and over again as it has to be an all time great in my opinion, the show is good for new comers and veterans alike as it has something for everyone. \n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall the shows is just breathtakingly beautiful and i'm sure you will enjoy it as much as i have, i love this show as it has a bit of everything, romance, action, adventure, suspense. And as i said its for everyone and i'm sure you'd love it to :D\n",
      "As someone who is fairly new to anime, I wasn’t really sure on what show I should watch, and with over 12,000 anime titles, it was hard to pick something to follow through on. Then came Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I was recommended this series in March 2015 by a friend, but it didn’t get around to it until May 2016, and I’ll be honest, I’m starting to kick myself for not getting onto this series earlier.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I’ll try not to spoil too much for you guys who haven’t watched this yet, and bear in mind, I’ve never read the manga, so Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "first time I was exposed to this solid story. Two brothers, Ed and Al Elric on a mission to get their mum back through the use of alchemic powers, but then sh*t happens; one loses their body, the other an arm and a leg. They end up uncovering all sorts of mysteries going down in their country, Amestris. That’s all I can say on the matter without spoiling it, but expect a lot of action, bloodshed and conspiracy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I gotta hand it to Hiromu Arakawa for this story and the way the anime writing team adapted it in the series; It flowed almost seamlessly as if the viewers were being exposed to real-time events taking place in the world, and among all of the action and countless loss of lives, it felt pretty realistic. That’s right, not keeping characters on to do justice to fans, the unexpected turn of events in the story, and a very clear and believable issue of life and humans being portrayed. There were also some light-hearted elements to ensure you weren’t too depressed from watching this, and I thought witty banter, unexpected jokes and sarcasm added to the overall value of the show. I lost count of the amount of times the episodes in this series left me thinking “holy sh*t”, “Why him/her” or “god, that was amazing”, or even make me laugh a bit. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a writer, I was impressed to see the vast amount out characters in this show, but also on top of that, each character was given just the right amount of exposure for you to cling on to them. I hate to compare, but thinking about some of the mediocre cartoons I watched when I was a kid, many secondary characters in some series don’t get a lot of possible on-screen time, and writers could have used them to an advantage to the overall story they were telling, and the writing team for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood did just that; for that, well done.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In terms of animation, Bones anime studio did a fantastic job on the this, from the realistic set designs and well-drawn characters, to the epic alchemic action scenes and transformation sequences. I’m familiar with the anime studio’s recent works, Akagami no Shirayukihime (Snow White with the Red Hair), which they did a good job on the setting, but I would admit it was not as great as the effort they put into increasing the believe factor of the viewers for this series’ animation.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Akira Senju did incredibly well with the soundtrack for this series and deserves every bit of praise for it. The music made every bit of this anime more immersive, and even though you may hear some of the songs again (as expected for anime), no matter how classical it is, I bet you will end up singing along with it. I’m not a fan of classical music, but for this soundtrack, I surely enjoyed every piece.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sub or Dub? I watched the FUNimation dub to this series. I’m not a sub watcher, and I’ve heard a lot from a few anime fans discouraging dubs in general. However, watching the dubbed version of this, who can argue the fact that the voice acting is just golden? Vic Mignogna and Maxey Whitehead did an absolutely stellar job on portraying Ed and Al Elric, along with many of the well-known names in the dubbing business: Ed Baylock, Colleen Clinkenbeard, J Michael Tatum, Todd Haberkorn, Travis Willingham and Chris Sabat, to name just a few, absolutely smashed it. So many of the greatest voice actors were put on the characters to bring each character to life the proper way, and I’ve got to thank FUNimation for their efforts.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I have praised this series, it does come with its slight downsides. Earlier I did mention there was some light-heated jokes that were injected into the series, but I personally felt the timing of the jokes in some episodes took away from the overall seriousness of the story at hand, which really did affect my standpoint on whether the matter of Ed and Al fighting to get their limbs and bodies back was a serious one, or one where it was preferable, but not important.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing I can’t help but criticise was the way some character emotions were portrayed in the show. In my opinion, I do think that some character emotions, such as anger, shyness and agitation, were over-exaggerated unnecessarily in the animation. I do get that this might have been done to conform with the style of anime and may have been an added value to the light-heatedness of the series, but this was something I wasn’t too jolly about, and maybe could have been toned down a little to make sure the story isn’t taken for granted.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To conclude, I’ll say this: as any other fan guy would say, “there should be more”, which may be want I want from an anime of this calibre, deep down I truly believe this anime is one of those series that is best left as it is: nothing more, nothing less. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is, without a doubt, a well-told, captivating and brilliant anime series, that every action-craver, whether you’re into anime or not, should at least make the effort to watch.\n",
      "I've said it for a long time that Fullmetal Alchemist is the Star Wars of anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By which I mean, It's over-hyped.It tries to do too many things, and doesn't stick to one proper theme, which completely makes the show seem completely disorganized and kinda pointless.I get neither a light hearted nor a serious feel, neither funny nor dramatic.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FMA:B has a pretty great story and decent pacing but poor exposition.The world building is half assed, and has no solidity.I personally, am not a great fan of it because of the vagueness of the storyline.Nothing is explained in detail and many parts of the story are weak,\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "but it has some great moments.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The character development is where it mainly lost me.The characters seem clichéd, and predictable(same feeling as star wars).There's not much effort made to build their characters.I would even enjoy the show if they had no characters, or traits or any development and the anime just concentrated on the plot.But it wasn't like that and the job was done poorly.Basically, the character building is not good.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I liked the art.It wasn't anything that made me swoon, but it was great with few superb visuals.The sound was more attractive to me than the art.Amazing VAs and great soundtracks.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, While I liked the story, art and sound,The story had a few weaknesses and the characters were shoddy. It has its moments, but it's nowhere near the \"Best Anime ever made\".\n",
      "A Generalized Review of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Initial Review for Newcomers: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a dark, action adventure that focuses on the Elric brothers' quest to regain what they had lost. This anime has good character development and a greater view of the world that the brothers live in. Like its predecessor, the themes of sacrifice, hardship/struggle, risk, maturity, morality and death are still ever present.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dub or Sub?: Both. Although, I do find the English dub team to be the greater of the two. Each voice actor sounded like they were born for their roles.\n",

      "the first Fullmetal Alchemist then you know the situation I'm in when writing this review.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Story: The story is centered around the grand adventure of Elric Brothers. If I say anymore, it will just spoil the show since there are no filler episodes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Elric Brothers: The Brothers, Edward and Alphonse, are on a quest of both atonement and discovery. Over the course of the show, the brothers are forced to grow up fast when they faced many problems that challenge their morals and ideals which govern their actions. Along their journey they meet many people who either help or hinder their quest. Eventually, they will later find that their problems are not the only ones that need fixing.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Supporting Cast Members: consist of over 30 characters so I'm not even going to get started on describing them all. Lets just say that they are all good in their own right.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art/Animation (10/10): The art/animation is modern. So there's not much to complain about.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound/Music (10/10): The sound/music was good. The opening and ending theme songs were acceptable for my taste.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enjoyment (10/10): I thoroughly enjoyed it. This anime is a must watch for everyone.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Summary/Overall (10/10): The story is great. The character development is great (considering the number of characters involved) and the amount of satisfaction is enormous. After that, feel free to watch the side-story Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos.\n",

      "I just finished watching the Original Full Metal Alchemist Anime and loved it. \r\n",
      "I didnt like the Artstyle in Brotherhood nor did I like the different storyline \r\n",

      "Synopsis:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alchemy is the art of transforming matter. However in order to create something, the alchemist has to present something of equal value; this is the golden rule of alchemy. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the story of two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric who are in search of a philosopher's stone, so that they can get back their bodies after a botched experiment with alchemy, in which Edward loses his arm and his leg and has to transmute Alphonse’s soul (which lost its body,) to a suit of armor when they tried to resurrect their mother after she died from a disease.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pros: \n",

      "Brilliantly highlight the characteristics\n",
      "                  ...\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The visuals are stunning, with beautiful character designs and animation.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The music for the most part good; in some instances beautiful.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The characters are always true to their personalities and characteristic.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Action scenes: Masterful; the cherry on top of all the other great qualities.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The symbolism  makes you wonder if this is anime or poetry?\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For fans of the manga, the anime doesn't follow it 1:1 and left out a few characters.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Has a different ending than ending than the FMA (2003) of you prefered that one.\n"
