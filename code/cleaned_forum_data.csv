However, I was disappointed with one of the little details conveniently left out.  The manga of this episode, <!--link--><a href=""http://www.onemanga.com/Full_Metal_Alchemist/31/16/"">the original Japanese form of the manga of this episode</a>, has Greed crucified.  When the chapters came to the US via VIZ Media, they edited the original art to make the cross-shaped slab of rock just a blob-shaped slab of rock.<br />
<br />
Not only did this episode change the shape that rock was in, but it changed Greed&#039;s position to arms by the side rather than straight out.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m no Christian-hater or Satan worshipper, but the symbolism of a sin getting crucified was something I found particularly powerful in the series.  I&#039;m very, very disappointed that it was removed from the series because of religious controversy.<!--color--></span>",great episode love series fact following manga however disappointed one little details conveniently left manga episode original japanese form manga episode greed crucified chapters came us via viz media edited original art make cross shaped slab rock blob shaped slab rock episode change shape rock changed greed 039 position arms side rather straight 039 christian hater satan worshipper symbolism sin getting crucified something found particularly powerful series 039 disappointed removed series religious controversy

"So... Interesting episode is interesting. The fights were just plain awesome. And all the revelations were just O_O<br />
<br />
King Bradley is and Homunculus as well... I knew there was something fishy about the guy but I never expected that. And what does he having the &quot;ultimate eye&quot; implicate? Somehow, I got the impression he could know what others were thinking... On that flashback Roy Mustang had in episode 10, about the Ishbal war, he seemed to notice Roy&#039;s intentions. Now he says Ed is a honest guy... He probably doesn&#039;t &quot;read thoughts&quot; literally but he does get some info from those glares. I&#039;m almost sure about that.<br />
<br />
And then there&#039;s &quot;Father&quot;, who created all the Homunculi and seems to have an hidden agenda I still can&#039;t figure out. Also, I think &quot;Father&quot; is also a certain someone&#039;s father. I hope not though, as it would be too predictable. Anyway, what surprised me the most was what I realized when Bradly talked about the sacrifices. When he said Al and Izumi were perhaps also suitable as sacrifices, I deducted that the sacrifices have to have seen the Truth. I have no idea why they need to have seen it or even what they&#039;re supposed to be scarified for. But things are getting better each episode.<br />

Hahaha yeah, I was thinking the same. It&#039;s pretty obvious from the get-go that he&#039;s a villain. Still, the buildup was done pretty well and he&#039;s shown to be a worthy adversary in this episode. His fighting skills are really badass and also terrifying tbh.

"Pretty good episode<br />
Followed the manga mostly .<br />
removed two or three things I wished they would have added , but oh well.<br />
Either way , this was mostly a &quot; how and why &quot; episode.<br />
Showed why and how the brother came to be how they are.<br />
with Ed seeing the Truth .<br />
then Roy meeting the brothers<br />
Ed vowing to take 1 year to recover and him consequently being able to transmute without Circles thanks to him having seen &quot;IT&quot; ( and Al not remembering).<br />
And finally Ed&#039;s Exam to become a state alchemist , where he promtly attacked Bradly who told him he still doesn&#039;t know the world xD.<br />
Thus showing how the fuhrur gave Ed an &quot;ironic&quot; name : the FullMetal Alchemist.<br />
<br />
Next week , they goin&#039; to Liore/Reole ~<br />
<br />
oh , and the score was pretty darn awesome.
