319465,11504299,"Note spoilers below.  However if your reading this thread it probably doesn't matter.It was kind of interesting...  However I couldn't help but ask 'where are the skateboards?' when ichigo kicked the crap out of those three punks.  Then the ghost was a boy rather than the little girl and I realized it was simply a new version...  Apparently the boy also got run over?  No explanation as to why his shrine happened to be by the roadside.  Or why he looked very similar to the parrot kid.Nothing new.  Again and again throughout the film important plot points, dilemma's, and problem's, were introduced and then solved...  Sometimes Mere Seconds Later.  It was helter skelter and crazed; I'm glad that Ishida got a bit more screen time and a new attack...  However I definitely won't be buying it...Honestly I found that I was actually more attached to 'kuboto' or whatever his name was then I was Ichigo freaking out over his sister.  He's just done it so many times now without any real growth in personality.  Whereas the villian was actually grieving; Ichigo was just raving as usual.  The main villian's character reminded me a bit too much of grim's design and personality.  The only difference being burns replacing hollowified bone.  Even his attack style is similar while still using a sword.  You could probably stack the two characters and come out with a mirror image with some small adjustments in color scheme.No objections really; Grim was easily one of my favorite villians.That being said it wasn't a waste of an hour and a half...  In fact I rather enjoyed it; what the fan subs failed to cover I managed to fill in rather easily...  After all it's not like we haven't heard all these lines before...  Again and Again.Lol.

The only actual part of the movie that I liked was the revamped fight between Hollow Ichigo and Ulquiorra. Honestly, the animation, and art in that 2 minute clip was just amazing. Overall, the only thing this movie had going for it, which was the hollow aspect, turned out to be a complete let down. I hated how Ichigo was so reluctant to use his Hollow mask. It was like, when he accidentally put it on all he could think to himself was ""WHAT!? I don't use this shit EVAR!"" Ichigo should have been spamming that crap left and right! And the fact that the enemy wanted Ichigo to go into that V2 Hollow form kind of killed it. It would have been way nicer if it was an unexpected transformation that made his enemy shit his pants all the way down to limbo. Plus the form was on-screen for like, what, a couple minutes? - tops! And all he did was spam cero's, not actually fight...Gah, I'm  getting to off-track with my complaints.

It's always good to see Chad and Ishda whenever we can (and Orihime, but she gets more screen time then those two anyway), along with the grass-roots opening bit (after Ulquiorra) with Ichigo kicking a coupla punks for knocking over a memento for the dead.Things that did bug though, we're Yuzu suddenly getting better. Even the way Byakuya lost his composure (you know somethings up when he does that) and rushed out, I thought they were going to make something of it, but then it just skipped along to Ichigo going back to hell. I mean, if Orihime, who can 'undo the works of God' can't remove the chains, then surely it'd require some sort of special task to undo the chains like destroying the source of them in hell or something, not just for them to fizzle like nothing. Without even Yamato saying 'oh yeah, that can happen in rare circumstances'. Nothing.Also, the whole thing with Kukoto saying 'you dont need to destroy the gates of hell, just my chains. So he goads ichigo into destroying the gates of hell. Then Ichigo comes back promising to defeat him, and breaks his chains. That bit did make me berate the screen for Ichigo being a numpty. But all was okay, because Hell just covered Kukoto in chains anyway. So, was Ichigo actually needed at all or did he just make things worse?Also, when Toshiro mentioned they'd only made repairs to the hell gate yesterday, I was all like 'Ooh, thats what Isshins meeting was all about (imagining him and Urahara drinking somewhere while prepping the maintenance)' but I guess not as they never mentioned it again.And it seems while shinigami have no control directly over hell, Ichigo is very compatible and ended up looking like an overseer of hell. So he's part human, part shinigami, part hollow, part hell guardian and   part fullbring (or should that be part object, since thats what fullbring powers seems to be about Since Bleach is the place for wild predictions, I now reckon that Isshin is actually the soul king making Ichigo some sort of super power-over-all messiah and God in training!",hmmmm well fun ride get wrong always good see chad ishda whenever orihime gets screen time two anyway along grass roots opening bit ulquiorra ichigo kicking coupla punks knocking memento dead things bug though yuzu suddenly getting better even way byakuya lost composure know somethings rushed thought going make something skipped along ichigo going back hell mean orihime undo works god remove chains surely require sort special task undo chains like destroying source hell something fizzle like nothing without even yamato saying oh yeah happen rare circumstances nothing also whole thing kukoto saying need destroy gates hell chains goads ichigo destroying gates hell ichigo comes back promising defeat breaks chains bit make berate screen ichigo numpty okay hell covered kukoto chains anyway ichigo actually needed make things worse also toshiro mentioned made repairs hell gate yesterday like ooh thats isshins meeting imagining urahara drinking somewhere prepping maintenance guess never mentioned seems shinigami control directly hell ichigo compatible ended looking like overseer hell part human part shinigami part hollow part hell guardian part fullbring part object since thats fullbring powers seems since bleach place wild predictions reckon isshin actually soul king making ichigo sort super power messiah god training!,-0.9887

319465,11562473,"Did they use some 3D stuff or did they just mess up the drawing at some parts?The golden armor was stupid. It would have been better if it would have been ""normal"" colored. Or a different design altogether.Loved that moment were Yuzu lost her chains and Byakuya was like ""wtf? i need to do...to do.. something!"" The overall thing was just stupid. Orihime is only limited by her will, if she wants something, or better, if she does not want something, it does not happen. It ""unhappens"". Why should she accept that Yuzu is dead, even worse, in hell (more or less)?I can understand Ichigo not giving a damn about how it happend, he's overwhelmed by the fact that he has Yuzu back, but others, like, Byakuya.. i excepted..well, something. If they vanish without them having to do anything, they could have let Orihimes ability work, too, it's not like tthen here would not have been a reason to do some awesome stuff.The part were the head captain was going ""thats all your fault"" was annoying. Where where all those captains when Shuren and his guys first attacked the school and kidnapped both Yuzu and Karin? Probably not responsible for it, it was related to hell after all! But then they want to stop Ichigo.The head captain himself should enter hell, or at least talk to the ones responsible. Surely hell is within jurisdiction of the Soul King, too. They are still souls there, after all. Heck, Soul Society is monitoring it, they have the ability to enforce a return,they do the maintenance of the gate  (i don't think the guardian are doing that..) and so on. Either they have to do something, or the Soul King. Perfect reason to introduce squad zero (unlikely outside the main story, but still..could have given us some corps dealing with hell coming directly from the Soul Kings court, would even explain the Gotei not lifting a finger to help. Another thing is, someone must have forbidden them to interact with everything hell related, either Yamaji or the Soul King, or someone even higher up, if there is such a thing. So there is a hierachy, and the one on top should have done something about it, even if not directly in control of hell.It also wasn't explained how they managed to get to the world of the living in the first place, if the guardians are so strong (though they look pretty weak when actually in hell. They looked more impressive before). Might be related to the maintenance they suddenly brought up. Probably Mayuri wanting some new stuff to study)Ichigo shooting cero after cero in his second hollow stage was nice at first, though it was a bit long. Still, it showed the power he has. They should have let him fight for real, as in, use his sword etc., like he did against Ulquiorra.Some of the other fights were good, with them kinda taking turns, though i knew how the final fight Rukia had was going to end the moment he captured her. It was so similar to the fight with Aaroniero. Either they planned that all along, or they just had the idea to end it the same way after they had that part.Overall, the movie was okay, probably my least favorite though. Would have been better if they had used the storyline of the promotional manga, with Szayel and Aaroniero ending up in hell. At least partially, they still could have the overall storyline, but not 20 minutes fighting without hollow form, 20 minutes fighting as hollow, 20 minutes fighting without hollow form, 20 minutes fightings to overcome the hollowfication, 5 seconds with the new form.Which reminde me of his fight with Aizen. New form, drastically different appearance, new skills, a single attack that takes out the enemy..or not. Both attacks did not kill the enemy, after both attacks someone or something else had to finish the job. He should stick with his hollow form, at least he managed to kill Ulquiorra with it. 1:0:0 when comparing hollow form, final getsuga tenshou and ""hell"" form.",use 3d stuff mess drawing parts golden armor stupid would better would normal colored different design altogether loved moment yuzu lost chains byakuya like wtf need something! overall thing stupid orihime limited wants something better want something happen unhappens accept yuzu dead even worse hell less understand ichigo giving damn happend overwhelmed fact yuzu back others like byakuya excepted well something vanish without anything could let orihimes ability work like tthen would reason awesome stuff part head captain going thats fault annoying captains shuren guys first attacked school kidnapped yuzu karin probably responsible related hell all! want stop ichigo head captain enter hell least talk ones responsible surely hell within jurisdiction soul king still souls heck soul society monitoring ability enforce return maintenance gate think guardian either something soul king perfect reason introduce squad zero unlikely outside main story still could given us corps dealing hell coming directly soul kings court would even explain gotei lifting finger help another thing someone must forbidden interact everything hell related either yamaji soul king someone even higher thing hierachy one top done something even directly control hell also explained managed get world living first place guardians strong though look pretty weak actually hell looked impressive might related maintenance suddenly brought probably mayuri wanting new stuff study ichigo shooting cero cero second hollow stage nice first though bit long still showed power let fight real use sword etc like ulquiorra fights good kinda taking turns though knew final fight rukia going end moment captured similar fight aaroniero either planned along idea end way part overall movie okay probably least favorite though would better used storyline promotional manga szayel aaroniero ending hell least partially still could overall storyline 20 minutes fighting without hollow form 20 minutes fighting hollow 20 minutes fighting without hollow form 20 minutes fightings overcome hollowfication 5 seconds new form reminde fight aizen new form drastically different appearance new skills single attack takes enemy attacks kill enemy attacks someone something else finish job stick hollow form least managed kill ulquiorra 1 0 0 comparing hollow form final getsuga tenshou hell form,-0.9974

It actually took ichigo 56 minutes to figure out that he knows how to use shunpo and that he, in bankai, is probably one of the top 5 fastest shinigamis that exist. Now why in the name of holy hell would he not use that when trying to save his sisters?

And then we have the main villain who, while being quite cool and all, was just a teeny tiny bit too overpowered. He took rampage-hollow-ichigos-world-ending-blaster-beam head on, and laughed, without even so much as a scratch. The same beam that blew ulqiorra to bits. I mean if he was that powerful then why couldn't he just cut off those damned chains by himself?

They kinda explained that in the actual show already. When a person dies, if they have something that keeps them connected to the human world they'll become a hollow if they remain there too long. (those spirits also risk bring eaten by hollows)Also, the shinigami come to release those spirits to wherever they need to be. The ones that have turned hollow are destroyed so they can go back to the soul society. However if the spirit that was turned into a hollow was a person who committed heinous crimes while alive they get sent to Hell.

319465,51474077,"I picked up this movie at a used book store when it was closing for good. I went a little overboard and bought a bunch of out-of-order anime... like volume 3 of an anime but not volumes 1-3 since the store didn't have them. I thought, ""Well, when it comes to watching in order, it's not too bad if it's a movie"". I have only watched maybe ten episodes of Bleach-- I think even out of order. I only remember about one episode of it. As for the manga, I think I've only read a few chapters of that too. That being said, I can into this movie not knowing all the nitty gritty on what was going on. I should have probably been lost, right? Actually, no. I have to say, the director did a really great job leading to project to tell a story which could easily be picked up by someone who didn't know much about the series. In fact, the movie started out like the one part I did remember about Bleach... which was a kinda stupid move in my opinion; I thought they were retelling the story in a different way for the movie at first. I was kinda confused. Still, I got from the movie that there's this dude, he sees spirits, some shinigami made him a substitute soul reaper society guy thing, he has power, he has a baaaad form which no one wants him to use and he doesn't want to use either. Oh, and the guy's mom's dead and I guess he's close to his sisters. I'm kinda guessing, btw. Maybe that's totally not what's what, but that's what I got from the movie. And if that IS what's what, then I feel like they did a good job introducing the world to new watchers. Like, wow, I didn't feel lost at all. I watched this dubbed. Considering the dub came out a while ago, I was expecting some relatively bad dubbing. The thing is, if it's Bleach, they can put in 5% and it's still going to sell because it's just that popular. They didn't need to put much effort in the dub to get money. I was really surprised to hear that the dub was actually done pretty well! Now, I'm not a dub hater, I just wasn't expecting 2012 to have some good dubbing on such a big title like this one. At this time, I expected more niche titles which couldn't use it's franchise fame to have the only ""good"" dubs, but this isn't the case. If it's niche, you gotta put more into it so it might have a chance, after all. I found, instead, that the voice actors were full of passion and had some good deliveries. I was looking away from the screen a lot just to analyze their delivery and sometimes just to concentrate on folding the clothes. I would find that the conversation on screen often sounded genuine, that the VAs really knew what they were doing. I'd perk my head up and start nodding, impressed. The dub just exceeded my expectations so much. There were maybe a few lines which made me stop and think, ""That wasn't the best delivery"". Lookin' at you, Uryuu-- and in Prince's defense, Uryuu doesn't seem like an easy character to play naturally just as the high-pitched genki girl often sounds just as unnatural (in both Japanese and English). Also, I love me some Michelle Ruff, but some (ONLY SOME) of her lines as Rukia fell flat, and I get it again: the type of tone she's required to use for the character often makes it difficult to emote. The deeper you make the voice, the harder to gets to emote-- sometimes. Depends. Wouldn't doubt if that's the case with Rukia as well. Meanwhile, the Japanese version had more than its fair share of lines which didn't sound too natural as well. Still, with my very few yet needlessly elaborated gripes, I felt it was a great dub. The best part of all was even without looking at the screen, I knew exactly what was going on just by the tone of everyone's voice, the use of sound effects, and soundtrack. That's good. That's really good. It's even led me to form a bit of an opinion about some folks. I've been listening to dubs, seeing how much they've improved over the years (A LOT), and yet I still hear the same old, ""Dubs suck. All dubs are bad"". Back in 2006? Yeah, sure; I'd have been shrugging and probably agreeing. In 2017, we're really getting a lot of good dubs and voice actors are putting a  lot of passion into their work. It shows, and it reflects well in the dubs. So to the folks who still insist on the ""Dubs suck. All dubs are bad"" mantra, I think it's time to step back a little and ask......are you even listening?! Have you been giving dubs chances recently? Are you just taking one VA, realizing that their delivery isn't too great and then canning the whole dub for it? Are you even listening to the Japanese version?! These dubs are becoming more and more solid. We've gotten away from the sucky dub era-- though I don't doubt that there are still some out there, but to keep on dismissing dubs with the same worn out mantra is just ignorant at this point. Good dubs are being made. Good dubs are being made kinda consistently. You aren't listening or you're nitpicking. It's time to change your excuse so I can stop having this conversation at parties...Me: Yeah, and they did a really great job on that dub. Everything sounded really natural. They localized it really well and the emotions came through really well. I actually thought the hiss was a nice touch and added a little to the character that a U.S. audience would pick up. It was good acting, really. Gosh I liked that choice.Anime newbie: Meh. I'l just watch with subs though cause all dubs suck.Me: Why do they all suck?Anime newbie: Well you know like my friend says they can't name even one good dub because they're all bad. And I've heard some and they're not too good.Me: What'd you watch?Anime newbie: Well, Naruto and-- after Naruto I was like screw dubs let's hear it in Japanese. It sounded better and it's the original so I just kept watching that.Me: =A=And it's like, man, you know these folks aren't listening to the Japanese line delivery really unless it's something that catches their ear. Just... I dunno, so many of the arguments for why dubs ""suck"" just can't be upheld anymore.""I want the literal translation and dubs don't give that! The meaning is lost!"" Dubs aren't Japanese learning tools. They're entertainment meant for a certain demographic. Things will possibly be changed based on marketability of the demographic. They're not supposed to have a literal translation; you're translating the idea/feeling, not the words exactly when it comes to entertainment. ""The voice actors sound wooden!"" Sure. In the original Japanese as well. There is something within this complaint that could be changed on the side of post production in the U.S. though. Voice actor's rarely record their lines with the other ""character"" they're supposed to be talking to, which sometimes makes it a bit hard to act at nothing. Voice actor's also don't often get time to read their lines beforehand. Maybe if the process changed, things would improve. BUT I personally feel that voice actors have stepped up their game considerably. I'm hearing nuances that I never used to hear in older dubs, and it's pretty friggen amazing to hear just how far voice actors have come even while STILL acting with nothing but paper, a mic, and air as opposed to having someone else's energy to work off of.""Why dub when subs work just fine?"" If you can see/read fine then I guess you'd be content, wouldn't you? There are folks who can't read, have trouble reading (dyslexia, other sight problems, or other disabilities which make watching difficult and audio beneficial), or are just straight up blind. Dubs are useful for many people. But also, since the goal is to market anime to people, there's an idea to make it as easy to watch as possible. So trying to get as many people to watch something as possible which is in another language? Dub that. I have so much to say, but it's five in the morning. Jfc. I'm just so sick of this ""Dubs suck"" thing when I'm hearing so much improvement in dubs holy moly. Just say you prefer subs BECAUSE YOU PREFER SUBS. ""I'm used to subs, so I stick to subs"". How hard is that as opposed to watching maybe five dubs-- ten dubs then deciding ""all dubs suck"". Jfc. Enough. I can't believe I'm still hearing this in 2017.  By the way, the rest of this movie wasn't even that much to write home about. Good paving the way for newbies and good dub. Other than that... lol wtf, I'm kinda ticked off with Rukia's character. What's up with all the female characters being so seemingly weak? I know this was 2010, but dang this stuff is still going on in 2017. Pssst, because they see it done by the ""greats"" before them. And that nude bit with Rukia? That's a damn shame. And who the hell was boob master over there glomping the small child? That was probably the least newbie friendly thing in the movie because I can't help but keep wondering, ""Wtf was up with that and why was it needed?"" Is it a running gag? I dunno. I can only assume it is. But it was kinda stupid since the whole movie was without that type of thing. Weird.

319465,55500622,"Opening the movie with that Ichigo vs Ulquiorra remaster was awesome as - dare I say it - Hell.  After that, the movie was decent but basically boiled down to Ichigo saving another girl.  Maybe it's just because I haven't watched Bleach in years, but this was definitely underwhelming in comparison to my memory of it.  It felt more like I was watching a filler with great action scenes.Still, it's the fights that keep me crawling back to this series.

It’s hard to make sense exactly why but I could feel a lot of love and passion for this. Obviously, the animation is fairly self-explanatory, but that final scene of the two sisters for example just left a smile on my face. On the other side of things, no idea how Yuzu managed to recover out of the blue there nor how Ichigo suddenly became the leader of Hell xD. My mind says 6/10 but my heart says 6.5/10 (=> 7/10).
