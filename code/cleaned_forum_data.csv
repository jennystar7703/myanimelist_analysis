Even basically copying the end scene but of course with different enemies and reasons. Unfortunately It just felt like nothing was added or revealed that bore any relevance to the series, unlike the second movie which at least gave insight into Hitsugaya's past. Instead they simply showed memories of things we had already seen and introduced and removed 2 completely pointless members of Rukia's past.Better than the first, worst than the second, Sealed Sword Frenzy still clinches it IMO (Renji with a shotgun lol) though technically an OVA.Urahara going ""all out"" lasted all of half a second which pissed me off to no amount as well but at least good use of Kon throughout gave the movie a light comedy feel.

Kenpachi's crazy action in this movie was epic win.Psycho!Possessed Rukia (Dark Rukia) actually really scared me. She was a real beast. I loved how it kept showing flash backs about Hisana and Byakuya. I've come to actually not hate Byakuya anymore, and I find him more interesting if anything because he isn't a douche like he used to be. I like the sort of brotherly sisterly connect they somewhat had in this movie.And with Bleach movies, I'm seeing somewhat of a pattern to the plots of each one. Each movie ALWAYS has to do with someone's memories..Memories of Nobody was about a girl who didn't know who she was and had all her memories gone (or had none to begin with, can't remember. Been awhile), Diamond Dust Rebellion was about someone from Hitsugaya's past, so he had to remember who they were and what they were to him, and now this one was about people forgetting Rukia and Ichigo, and Mayuri forgetting multiple things as well. Memories Memories Memories make the world go round in Bleach.The only thing I guess I didn't like was Homura. She was one of those whiny female characters voiced by...ugh..Hirano Aya. Why she even had to be involved with ANY Bleach project is beyond me. So, sorry to any Hirano Aya fans, but I just don't like her and find her voice quite annoying.

He went to sleep and when he got the visions, he remembered, but when other people got the visions, they didn't remember.  That was totally inconsistent.  Kon was such an annoying character throughout the entire movie.  He just seemed out of place with the entire seriousness of the plot, with his pathetically forced comedy scenes.  Also, I found the the girl (Homura, as her named was revealed) to be quite annoying and the writers could have done a better job with her backstory.  But that's not to big a deal I suppose.  Well, at least we didn't have an excessively emo Toushirou throughout the entire movie.  And lol @ Matsumoto having like two lines in the movies.  That's what you get for trying to force every character onto screen.  At least they wisely left out Inoue, Chad and Ishida.And I love how this movie totally disregarded the relationship between Urahara and the Shinigami.  He was a traitor.  His crimes were pretty offensive to them.  I highly doubt they would have taken him for truth as much as they showed.  But this was a fan-service movie, so that could be forgiven.Lastly, THIS movie should have been named ""Memories of Nobody"" instead of ""Fade to Black.""  It fits perfectly.  :/Anyway, final 5/10, and that's being nice.

119760,5967447,"I'm sorry, but I really don't see how anyone could have thought this was decent?  this was 5/10 at best, and i love bleach.1. Art.  The eyes and the faces at times were really un-bleach like, they were ugly, distracting, and didn't fit.  The animation was great at times, and bad at others, and it felt like i was watching the same animations over and over again for the snake battles.2. Movie characters.  Seriously, these are the lamest, dumbest, neediest, retarded child minded villains ever.  Completely unlikeable, not in the way that you hate a villain, but in the way you hate bad characters that shouldn't have existed.  I was always expecting a real villain to turn up... that would have at least been mildly interesting.3. Plot.... whooo boy.  First of amnesia, it's the writers fallback for when you are out of ideas.  From the beginning it was fail.  A hour of IT'S ME ICHIGO! DON'T YOU REMEMBER! DID YOU FORGET RUKIA? HOW ABOUT ME iCHIGO! WHAT ABOUT RUKIA! HEY WAIT I'M STILL ICHIGO!  Then we get to see soul societies whole ""let's hack up whatever comes into sight instead of actually trying to solve any crimes or do anything productive""  It's obvious that Ichigo never meant any harm to anyone. The villains were totally unlikeable... then come the plotholes!!!A.  How did the kids know about the device, or what it was going to do?  They basically fled to hueco mundo, then stayed there for 100 years and came back for rukia.  Was it Aizen's crazy plan?  If so they could of at least hinted at somethingB. They clearly dominated over the hollows mind, why do they hate shinigami's?  Sure they were attacked by one, but after 100 years they should have realized that he was possessed, even rukia said ""your not a shinigami your a monster!"" in a scream during the fight.  It could be part of bleaches brilliant talking system where you can yell at the top of your lungs and not be heard, but people 100 feet apart floating in air can have a pleasant chat in a normal talking voice.  C. If they forgot everything about rukia, and Ichigo, then they would have to have forgotten about aizen's betrayal.  Shouldn't they have been more concerned that there was 3 captains that didn't exist?  And how many memories would have to be erased for aizen/other 2 to nto exist, and then so on and so on.  Eventually there would have been no memories at allD. Why didn't they just come back to Rukia and greet her, why did they destroy soul society, they could have just as easily teleported to rukia, grabbed her reaped her memory, and left.  They constantly were causing a havoc(for movie fanservice?) just for the sake of it, even though there was no plot reason as to why they did it.  E.  Why did the kids have the power to teleport?  Did i get that right?  Why did 2 random kids be able to do something nobody else can do.  No shinigami have powers like that, maybe hollows.  But shinigami can only use kidou and their swords powers.  Not a single one has a special ability exclusive to them outside of sword/kidou.  If it was the hollow that could teleport, why did it teleport into the kids, ""it was a mistake!"" how convenient if thats the case...4. Music it had it's ups and downs, but mostly downs, at one point they played a song that sounded like it came straight out of naruto.  Was totally not like bleach",sorry really see anyone could thought decent 5 10 best love bleach 1 art eyes faces times really un bleach like ugly distracting fit animation great times bad others felt like watching animations snake battles movie characters seriously lamest dumbest neediest retarded child minded villains ever completely unlikeable way hate villain way hate bad characters existed always expecting real villain turn would least mildly interesting 3 plot whooo boy first amnesia writers fallback ideas beginning fail hour ichigo! remember! forget rukia ichigo! rukia! hey wait still ichigo! get see soul societies whole let hack whatever comes sight instead actually trying solve crimes anything productive obvious ichigo never meant harm anyone villains totally unlikeable come plotholes!!!a kids know device going basically fled hueco mundo stayed 100 years came back rukia aizen crazy plan could least hinted somethingb clearly dominated hollows mind hate shinigami sure attacked one 100 years realized possessed even rukia said shinigami monster! scream fight could part bleaches brilliant talking system yell top lungs heard people 100 feet apart floating air pleasant chat normal talking voice c forgot everything rukia ichigo would forgotten aizen betrayal concerned 3 captains exist many memories would erased aizen nto exist eventually would memories alld come back rukia greet destroy soul society could easily teleported rukia grabbed reaped memory left constantly causing havoc movie fanservice sake even though plot reason e kids power teleport get right random kids able something nobody else shinigami powers like maybe hollows shinigami use kidou swords powers single one special ability exclusive outside sword kidou hollow could teleport teleport kids mistake! convenient thats case music ups downs mostly downs one point played song sounded like came straight naruto totally like bleach,-0.9792

There was a lot of potential to make the story and villains better, but hey this is Bleach we're talking about.The problem (one of them, really) with Bleach is that it has too many cool characters, and when they try to fit them all you can only see them use 10 seconds for each. It could be better if they showed less characters and tried to flesh a few out better than fanservice the fans of each by making them go bankai for a moment.You can see they didn't try too hard with the animation, either. The fight scenes are of course fluid and decent (this IS movie) but the character designs are very inconsistent. Ichigo seems to have had 5-7 different designs in this movie alone, and Rukia's enormous eyes were very weird to stare at.All in all this is good for ichiruki and rukia-tard fans, but this movie shows the lack of motivation the staff possessed when doing it.

He went to sleep and when he got the visions, he remembered, but when other people got the visions, they didn't remember.  That was totally inconsistent.  Kon was such an annoying character throughout the entire movie.  He just seemed out of place with the entire seriousness of the plot, with his pathetically forced comedy scenes.  Also, I found the the girl (Homura, as her named was revealed) to be quite annoying and the writers could have done a better job with her backstory.  But that's not to big a deal I suppose.  Well, at least we didn't have an excessively emo Toushirou throughout the entire movie.  And lol @ Matsumoto having like two lines in the movies.  That's what you get for trying to force every character onto screen.  At least they wisely left out Inoue, Chad and Ishida.And I love how this movie totally disregarded the relationship between Urahara and the Shinigami.  He was a traitor.  His crimes were pretty offensive to them.  I highly doubt they would have taken him for truth as much as they showed.  But this was a fan-service movie, so that could be forgiven.Lastly, THIS movie should have been named ""Memories of Nobody"" instead of ""Fade to Black.""  It fits perfectly.  :/Anyway, final 5/10, and that's being nice.

So personally I wasn't surprised by the lack of plot/character development, that's just not what Bleach movies are about.The animation was damn good and I just loved the art.

Toushiro: ""Everything. Including myself."" - I rotfl'ed.5) If there was no Rukia, Soi Fon has not fought with Yoruichi and has not forgiven her yet. Seems like they forgot about that little detail - Yoruichi wouldn't go back to Seireitei had Rukia not been taken so Soi should still be mad at her.6) Renji to Ichigo: ""There's something I need to ask her. Why are you doing all of this to save her?"" I have a better question - why are you calling Ichigo ""her""?7) If I ever read fanfics about vampire or arrancar Rukia again I will always imagine her like that - simply awesome (if a bit too pale)!8) What the hell did they do with Shunko?!?!

It's supposed to be strong enough to tear her gear, and last time I checked it was showed as flame-like reiatsu coming out of shoulders and back not some puny glow around your body!9) Kenpachi's awesome as always, but was he supposed to be bleached?

What also annoyed me was the constant variation of characters' height.Example:   Damn it, Soi Fon, you've grown quite a bit over such a short time span.The honour of the most annoying part goes to Ichigo in replay mode: Rukia, it's me, ichigo, remember, Rukia, it's you, think, Rukia, do you still not remember, snap out of it Rukia.All in all, it was a fine movie, nothing to write home about, but it delivers an hour an a half of enjoyable (albeit forgettable) fun and that is basically what bleach is about.7/10 from meP.S.
