This episode is one I have been waiting for for sooooooo long. I had a amazing experience since I rewatched the whole show during the week while waiting for this episode.<br />
<br />
The animation was amazing this episode and many things looked really stunning.<br />
<br />
The music was amazing!! I love the use of the first ED by Halca (my personal favourite ED from the show) it was amazing to hear it again! The music was really done well and it made scenes even more emotional.<br />
<br />
Okay now to the scene I have been waiting to talk about which is the kiss scene. This scene was one of the best if not THE BEST confession/kiss in all romance anime I&#039;ve seen. I love the buildup to it and I love how amazing Shirogane was when he was on the tower. Playing Sentimental Crisis while leading up to the kiss was perfect. I loved when they showed the flashbacks to all the previous seasons, it really made me tear up. When they finally kissed I cried with happiness.<br />
<br />
This was the best episode of the whole show and I can&#039;t wait for another season.<br />

You do realize that Kaguya in the series is one of the most unobtainable people in Japan? If it weren&#039;t for Miyuki being the president of a school of important peoples kids, he wouldn&#039;t be allowed to step a meter by her outside of school. <br />

"I wish there was a way to score an anime higher than 10/10 because this season is the best single season from any show or anime I have ever watched. This is the first romance anime that I have seen be so well paced in regards to when they want to add the truly romantic and progress building scenes. While it did take 3 season to get to the point where Kaguya and Shirogane have outwardly expressed their feelings about each other, the unique and unorthodox relationship between these two main leads kept the other seasons interesting. Their competitive outlook towards love created many scenes where the viewers were left on a cliff or the characters were on the verge of making huge decisions, however, becuase of the unique nature that has been built around these characters, it makes sense as to why they have hesitated so many times. This is something anime&#039;s and manga&#039;s like Rent-A-Girlfriend completely fail to achieve. The completely ordinary archetype between the two main leads that an anime like Rent-A-Girlfriend uses leaves complete predictability, and the sloppy pacing ruins the whole romance aspect of the show, no longer making it enjoyable. However, Love is War completely mastered the art of pacing to keep their viewers engaged and interested.<br />
<br />
In addition, the whole supporting cast of this show, for example characters like Ishigami, Fujiwara, Iino, Hayasaka, and others blend completely with the vibe and truly embody what a Romance Comedy is about. It has been clear that there is a lot of effort put into developing these side characters and their relationships, and as a result, it creates a real sense of community between these main and supporting characters, rather than isolating the two main leads and focusing on only them.<br />
<br />
This is the only anime I have actively been waiting for and been genuinely looking forward to watching over the past two years. At the end of 2020 I had watched most of the best anime&#039;s and my standards increased with my attention span decreasing. I had barely watched anime over the past. year, but I had still been waiting and anticipating the release of this season. This season was everything I wanted to be and more, making Love is War easily my favorite romance anime as well as the Season 3 being the best single season I have ever watched. Thank you Aka Akasaka and the animation team for creating this wonderful story, I can&#039;t wait to see what&#039;s next.

Well as shocking as Shirogane&#039;s reveal was, even Kaguya couldn&#039;t help but be perplexed for a moment. Knowing this will be his last cultural festival until he departs for America 10 months later, it&#039;s now or never. Though have to say Hayasaka&#039;s knack of making any situation a humorous one just never gets old. Loved how she consolidated and supported Kaguya throughout the split episode...<br />
<br />
The one who confesses first loses, that&#039;s how it used to be but now neither Shirogane nor Kaguya backing down from that absolute resolve of confessing by the end of this cultural festival. And Shirogane aka Phantom thief doing every damn thing to make no one interfere (talking about you Chika) from this history making event. But now&#039;s not the time to have any second thoughts...<br />
<br />
These two panels alone hold much more relevance than maybe hundreds and hundreds of whole damn shows out there, and I&#039;m still being generous. The buildup over the last two seasons to make it up to this point was only one of its kind, and as unfortunate as it sounds it&#039;s highly possible we won&#039;t ever witness something of this magnitude again...<br />
<br />
The kiss scene was perfection and of course Hayasaka&#039;s reaction was gold.

Couldn&#039;t have asked for such a perfect ending to this wild ride. Waiting 2 weeks for the dubbed to be released was worth the wait.  Fingers crossed for a 4th season &lt;3,039 asked perfect ending wild ride waiting weeks dubbed released worth wait fingers crossed 4th season lt 3
"Kaguya-sama: Love is War s3 is probably the best ending i could&#039;ve asked for this series to end on. For 3 straight years this series did a fantastic job at balancing romance and comedy within each season. The comedy imo wasn&#039;t cringe or over used at all, the romance wasn&#039;t painfully cheesy but also not dragged so far out it got boring to watch. Season 3 kept to its roots and tied the series up with a unique way only it could do.<br />
<br />
Story obviously was a bit more romance heavy with the characters having developed that it definitely felt reasonable for it to happen. The romance and comedy this season, again, felt like a great balance. Plenty of scenes this season alone i&#039;ve been laid waste to laughing my ass off, and lots of scenes had me pretty on edge between whether Kaguya or Shirogane would confess first, but heck a kiss to end it? I ain&#039;t complaining. <br />
[spoiler=&quot;More thoughts on story&quot;] <br />
Side characters also received a lot of love, Ishigami had his whole romance arc that helped build his character further, Fujiwara did feel quite docile this season ngl, Iino definitely had her moments especially with the last arc. What a day to be a Hayasaka fan tho, arguably in the last stretch getting lots of love and her own arc and so much development.<br />
[/spoiler]<br />
<br />
Character development imo has always been a staple for this show and this season no less was outstanding with it. Kaguya and Shirogane development for one another and their own character was great to watch this season, they kept a create build up of each of their own characters until the last season, but also doing a great job at reminding viewers how far both these people have come since we first saw them, and they saw first saw each other. Ishigami also getting his own arc with Tsubame was definitely a great way to help show how much his character had changed from his initial appearances. Side characters also received a good amount of love as well, Maki turned into this kinda tsundere with a sharp tongue, to this depressed third wheeler who couldn&#039;t escape but also handed out life advice which became scarily relatable to me. Again, as a Hayasaka fan i couldn&#039;t be more happy with the amount of attention she got this season, they expanded a lot more on her character then her simply being [i]&quot;kaguya&#039;s therapist&quot;[/i]  and touched more on her as her own character. Sadly she might of taken an L in the romance department but this season showed enough screen time for me that i&#039;m happy as is. Asides from that quite a good amount of new characters were also introduced. <br />
<br />
Visuals were still the same which was to be expected. One thing i&#039;ll say is in ep8 where they used actual panels from the manga to help convey certain scenes better was pretty well done. I wish they did it a bit more leading to the end but oh well. <br />
<br />
Voice acting again this season was amazing. I don&#039;t think there isn&#039;t one student council member that hasn&#039;t absolutely gone of the hook and absolutely screeched down the mic as if they were getting killed. Getting Masayuki Suzuki to do another opening at this point was almost necessary, dude kills it all the time and is another staple for the show. The ED once again had its own unique feel, but good lord ep5 standalone ED has to be the hardest and fastest curve ball this series has thrown to date, the animation and beat are amazing and getting Makoto Furukawa and Konomi Kohara to do the vocals was the icing on top.<br />
<br />
And just a little something for the entire series, i absolutely love this series. Personally my favorite RomCom to date, with some of the best character development i&#039;ve ever seen. I loved all the character shown, each felt unique and had a purpose in the show. The story was hooking with its balance of great comedy and romance ideas. The ED and OP&#039;s of the series have also understandably become quite iconic and the visuals were always great to watch.<br />
<br />
All in all season 3 would probably have to be a 9/10 for me, imo they tied the story up reasonably well, the humor still had me dying for another year in a row, the romance really had me and i was hooked on it, all the characters ended up being lovable due to how much they grew on me with their individual developments. Sadly after 3 years it pains me greatly to think that this time next year we won&#039;t get to see anymore, and is the last time we&#039;ll see the student council and Hayasaka my beloved.

"Anime com um final de temporada perfeito. O meu favorito. Impec&aacute;vel. Ainda trouxeram o tema Sentimental crisis, perfeito. Google translate&nbsp;",anime com um final de temporada perfeito meu favorito impec aacute vel ainda trouxeram tema sentimental crisis perfeito google translate nbsp
"Non-verbal confession on both sides? Shirogane with heart balloons, Shinomiya with a kiss. Both followed up with &quot;This is how I feel about you.&quot; I originally thought those are both still confessions, but it sounds like they didn&#039;t think so. I guess it&#039;s not really the same as actually hearing your crush tell you verbally that they like you, as Shinomiya pointed out afterward. It&#039;s not as clear. And it&#039;s not the same as asking them out, either, technically.<br />
<br />
But in that case, I&#039;m slightly disappointed in both of them: they had each previously already resolved to be the one to humble themselves, trust the other first, and say the words, thereby accepting defeat and ending their war. Yet neither of them was able to follow through on those intentions. Even after three seasons, they&#039;re still holding back and trying to manipulate the other into showing their hand first. Have they learned nothing?",non verbal confession sides shirogane heart balloons shinomiya kiss followed quot feel quot originally thought still confessions sounds like 039 think guess 039 really actually hearing crush tell verbally like shinomiya pointed afterward 039 clear 039 asking either technically case 039 slightly disappointed previously already resolved one humble trust first say words thereby accepting defeat ending war yet neither able follow intentions even three seasons 039 still holding back trying manipulate showing hand first learned nothing

"Well as much as shocking Shirogane&#039;s reveal was, even Kaguya couldn&#039;t help but be perplexed for a moment. Knowing this will be his last cultural festival until he departs for America 10 months later, it&#039;s now or never. Though have to say Hayasaka&#039;s knack of making any situation a humorous one just never gets old. Loved how she consolidated and supported Kaguya throughout the episode.<br />
<br />
The one who confesses first loses, that&#039;s how it used to be but now neither Shirogane nor Kaguya backing down from that absolute resolve of confessing by the end of this cultural festival. And Shirogane aka Phantom thief doing every damn thing to make no one interfere(talking about you Chika) from this history making event. But hey you both now&#039;s not the time to have any second thoughts lmao.<br />

These two panels alone hold much more relevance than maybe hundreds and hundreds of whole damn shows out there, and I&#039;m still being generous. The buildup over the last two seasons to make it up to this point was only one of its kind, and as unfortunate as it sounds it&#039;s highly possible we won&#039;t ever witness something of this magnitude again.<br />

"The dilemma of Shirogane with his Stanford admission is truly heartbreaking for Kaguya because it&rsquo;s going to be difficult for them to interact closely with one another, well it&rsquo;s not vivid how they&rsquo;re going to handle it. Also, Hayasaka deserves to be a love counselor because she got elegance and tries to suit what&rsquo;s best for Kaguya&rsquo;s own need for confessing her love to Shirogane. <br />
 <br />
At this point, more than 2 seasons are needed because Tsubame told Ishigami that she&rsquo;s having a hard time when deciding her feelings towards him since they didn&rsquo;t really get to know each other, well they&rsquo;re in different years so interactions are limited at all cost, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re doing it at their own pace until it&rsquo;s the final decision for the upcoming months. <br />
 <br />
Love it when Chika the detective is hype up with all the thief investigation lmao it was so serious, obviously, the culprit of everything stolen is Shirogane, he literally made the &ldquo;Big Ball&rdquo; and look at his disguise man (Heck they even made a POV lol), definitely intended for putting Kaguya on the test to reach the rooftop which is where the confession begins and it went BALLOONSSSS EVERYWHEREEEEE, Shirogane is a smart guy, you don&rsquo;t confess through words, you confess it through a symbolic presentation! glad they kissed in the end ;_( It was worth the wait and a 10/10 1-HOUR-EPISODE, 8.5/10 overall (1st half was kinda weak but 2nd half was more engaging) <br />

So many fun moments, so much comedy. The love depicted in this show genuinely feels like, yes, it has some weight. I don&#039;t know why I feel that but that&#039;s how it is. It&#039;s just so fucking good.<br />
<br />
Hats off to A-1 Pictures and all the beautiful staff involved in this show. Every season gets better than the previous one. Aka-sensei, GOAT. This season was full of bangers and some hidden gems here and there like DDD. But, my god, this episode made me tear up and all the emotions I felt during this episode. I can&#039;t describe...

"Tbh, some of my favorite moments from this final episode is between Kaguya and Hayasaka. These two didn&#039;t have too much screen time this season but the finale captured their wonderful chemistry again.<br />
<br />
However, the best part imo is between Kaguya and Miyuki with their usual love war shenanigans. Miyuki looked like a badass in his outfit with that top hat. Felt like character emotions hit its peak in this finale especially with the chereography and emotional elements. Miyuki really played out his emotions into this episode.<br />
<br />
What a finale! Best episode of the season.<br />

"Missed the first 20 or so minutes of Tokyo MX&rsquo;s screening, so a lot of the buildup may have been missing from my experience. I&rsquo;ll have to get back to watching the sub version in a bit for my full disclosure. <br />
<br />
Not going to lie, I was expecting a typical love confession but silly me should&rsquo;ve known by now that the show has its own style of addressing the obvious and Shirogane-san nailed it! &ldquo;Come to Stanford with me.&rdquo; - Yes, that&rsquo;s the spirit! That&rsquo;s how to end this bizarre scheme, on top of the balloon outburst in the background of course. Hopefully, the Shinomiya family won&rsquo;t be too much of an obstacle to see through this. It&rsquo;s funny how she quickly dispelled that thought and honestly who can blame her at that point. <br />
<br />
Hayasaka blushing over Kaguya going over her kiss with Shorogane was hilarious, she is a teenager yet to experience love after all. I can&#039;t believe how Kaguya went over to the details of the French kiss that she shared with the Pres though, lol. <br />
<br />
Little moment between Iino and Ishigami was nice to see. Despite everything, Ishigami definitely keeps a close eye on her. Maki-chan and Kashiwagi-san&#039;s scene plus Osaragi-san&#039;s scenes were pretty nice too. <br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s not exactly surprising that news of a sequel is already out but I&rsquo;m definitely looking for more from the series. As a whole, I felt this season may have been the weakest imo despite being the most romance focused. But it&rsquo;s still a 9/10 in my books so who cares xD.<br />
<br />
Edit: Definitely missed a lot, after all. <br />
<br />
Kaguya took it surprisingly well at the start there, but that was only for a bit understandably. Hayasaka egging it on with the threats of potential love from Stanford girls was hilarious. Ultra romantic confession - not a bad plan at all but I suppose Shirogane&#039;s plan outdid this by a fair margin. 5 Ws and 1 H, that was ridiculous, for the love of God. Kaguya&#039;s genuine tears though...<br />
<br />
On another end, I really liked where the Ishigami - Tsubame-senpai ship was going but I suppose there&#039;s still some hope left. Gee, that misunderstanding though. How&#039;d he mess up that bad? But I suppose he definitely managed to show off his patience at least and that&#039;s a good trait to have. Didn&#039;t expect him to be so informed about flowers, he must&#039;ve played a decent chunk of romantic games to get this far. Congrats to him! And hey, he finally figured out his confession lmao. <br />
<br />
Cosplay idea was good but good lord, Shirogane&#039;s fashion sense. Respect to him for going through all that rouble to set the stage right though. In particular, the recommendation letter from the Principal, that&#039;s a very bold but wise move. His inferiority complex was somewhat surprising to see but thankfully he attempted to get the message across regardless. Kaguya&#039;s assertiveness for the kiss was quite something! <br />
<br />
And I don&#039;t know how I didn&#039;t notice it earlier but &quot;Sentimental Crisis!&quot; I saw halca-san&#039;s post on twitter and I wondered why she pointed out that the ED theme was trending and I finally figured it out xD.

Hayasaka&#039;s tears though was pretty funny but showed just how much she was rooting for her. Hayasaka&#039;s plan sure was a great one. But such an emotional plan is not one that Kaguya can do without extensive prep though. Full points to Ishigami for being well prepared for the elements. Its nice that despite the delay that Ishigami finally realized what he did. Using a bow to start the bonfire with fire arrows though is quite the tradition. Thats some impressive deduction that Chika and Kaguya showed. But to think this prank was actually perpetrated by Miyuki. But it was amusing seeing how spent both leads are by this point in time. The confession scenes on the clocktower was so well done. The surprise that Miyuki prepared was such an amazing one as well not to mention beautifully animated. Recording the bonfire was a nice gesture on Ishigami&#039;s part. Overall a most excellent finale that managed to end the season a high note with the crown jewel being the long awaited confession. Can&#039;t wait to see the new season when it comes out. ,hayasaka 039 tears though pretty funny showed much rooting hayasaka 039 plan sure great one emotional plan one kaguya without extensive prep though full points ishigami well prepared elements nice despite delay ishigami finally realized using bow start bonfire fire arrows though quite tradition thats impressive deduction chika kaguya showed think prank actually perpetrated miyuki amusing seeing spent leads point time confession scenes clocktower well done surprise miyuki prepared amazing one well mention beautifully animated recording bonfire nice gesture ishigami 039 part overall excellent finale managed end season high note crown jewel long awaited confession 039 wait see new season comes

"Usually when I watch anime, my mind can be somewhere else but watching these last two episodes my mind was just fully focused on watching it. As a manga reader, this ending was not 10/10 though, cause the post-kiss talk Kaguya had with Hayasaka was different. Hayasaka said to Kaguya that you&#039;re not supposed to kiss with your tounge for the first time since you exchange body fluids, they also called called Kashiwagi to double check which was hilarious.<br />

Also, first time they walked into the student council room Kaguya entered Kaguya-chan mode which had a huge impact on what will happen later so I have no clue what they were thinking there.<br />

"The conclusion to this season as expected was fantastic and super satisfying to watch, and was a massive brightspot in what was a fairly weak season for Kaguya-sama standards imo besides this arc. There were a lot of segments I found to be a bit boring or repetitive, more than the first 2 seasons combined. But at least A-1 delivered strong with this conclusion and brought a massive event in this series to life in a beautiful fashion. Good to see Kaguya and Shirogane finally have their moment together after all this time.<br />

New project already announced soon too, so there&#039;s only more to come for this series. Sucks that this season is still the weakest among the 3 since this season would actually be pretty mediocre and forgettable for me until this Cultural Festival arc and conclusion in particular here.

<br />
People talking about 2023, was something annouced at the end?!<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
Seems like a continuation was announced, and after seeing the ending of S3, you really cant have it the other way, because there is no lead from that kiss, it was just insane, when a few pages later in the manga Kaguya would go all shy realising what she has done, for Shirogane there was not something more destructive than that, good luck sleeping.<br />
Still, they had an original scene with them holding hands at the end, in a way if S3 was the end, it would still have ended at the absolute appex possible!<br />
<br />
Well the deed is done, it was a confession NOT confessing by words but gestures, I loved how creative they were in adapting such a tough sequence, the visuals were amazing but specially the soundtrack, it was outstanding, I will definitly grab it when it comes out.<br />
<br />
Hayasaka panting was soo weirdly funny to watch, it is always she that gets the indirect strikes when her master&#039;s cover is about to be blown up!<br />
<br />
This episode is 10/10, just perfect.<br />
<br />
Season 3 ending so strongly obviously is 10/10, more precisaly 9.7/10, details, the climax here is the best I have seen in almost anything and more so for romcoms, but there were also tons of other great episodes through out, at least half of them slowly developing to this climax, and any manga reader or anime watching revisting will appreciate that, then you had episodes like 5 that surpassed by far the manga, making plain better than it was.<br />
<br />
I was skeptical about S4, but it seems we are really getting it, it wont peak as much as this ending did, but great things await nonetheless.<br />
Really, I think season 3 of this series will go down in story especially with this climax, as the role model of romantic comedies, that no one will be able to replicate again.

"It is very rare we get stories in anime that are as exceptional as Kaguya sama. Truly not many are atop of Kaguya sama in terms of quality. This third season reaffirmed and showed again how incredible this whole package really is. The typical laughs but added this season with a heaping helping of drama surrounding our main couple. As we got further along things definitely ramped up the tension. But of course I loved earlier on the season had many funny moments with the arm wrestling and the rapping and the karaoke and eventually the climatic culture festival itself. Maki became a really standout character in this season now that her friendship with Ishigami and Shirogane was shown more. The meat of this season did focus on the culture festival though, since it changes everything in Kaguya sama going forward. <br />
<br />
The biggest shift in this story so far culminating with one of the best confessions in anime history. I cried basically the whole time both Kaguya and Shirogane were each explaining why they needed the other to confess instead of themselves. Both have equally valid reasons for not wanting to take that first step. Kaguya thinking maybe she&#039;s just imagining Shirogane likes her back since hes so nice to everyone maybe she&#039;s just a part of that and not special to him. Shirogane thinking he&#039;s not worthy to stand on equal ground with Kaguya since theyre from different worlds and she&#039;s such a higher status above him. Its much more complex than anyone could&#039;ve thought back when this story first started. Each of the two having deep rooted insecurities that keep them from expressing their true feelings. Something that&#039;s insanely relatable and understandable. I couldn&#039;t help but bawl my eyes out seeing them both open up to each other like that for the first time. <br />
<br />
Even if its not the classic saying I like you or I love you to each other its a confession none the less. Things might be up in the air a bit however they&#039;re choosing to stay by each others side says it all. Kaguya choosing to follow Shirogane to Stanford is a huge decision for her and him, they deserve to find happiness together. I couldn&#039;t be more happy with this season of Kaguya sama. We&#039;re truly blessed to get such a great adaptation of a great story. The visuals looked fantastic the whole confession scene, you can tell the staff love this as much as we do. Another great season that shows how Kaguya sama gets better and better as it goes. Excited for more later on. <br />

This episode was really good.,episode really good
"The bombshell that Shirogane would be studying overseas at Stanford, this is his last and final culture festival. Of course, Hayasaka likes to put ideas into Kaguya&#039;s head, but this case is for real, and if Kaguya missed this chance, there wouldn&#039;t be another. It&#039;s time to confess, the Ultra Romantic way, BY HOOK OR BY CROOK. Even to the point of being a visualization game and the English topical 5W1H, practicing the confession for that special someone is as how Hayasaka does, done with heart.<br />
<br />
Nice to see Tsubame and Ishigami, and even after all that accusation of the latter, he doesn&#039;t show his feelings outright and can get flustered, so someone like Tsubame is easily a good fit for him that he is experiencing something new, but still goes off base for Tsubame to work her innings out. It&#039;s only after giving the cookie then he realized the true gravity of his actions.<br />
<br />
The end of the culture festival with the bonfire and dragon&#039;s ball, this is a case of love and thievery for Kaguya and Chika, and through the cryptic messages that are deciphered one after another, Kaguya is ready to issue her confession...with a canned coffee and trinkle heart, but going missing???<br />
<br />
Love Is War! This has always been the game between Kaguya and Shirogane for the past 3 seasons, and it has all culminated to this moment. The phantom thief Arsene and the damsel in romantic distress, their talk upon Shuchiin Academy&#039;s clock tower and the present of love, delved from Shirogane&#039;s Ultra Romantic campaign that&#039;s all planned to perfection. <br />
<br />
The heart balloons that all fleet towards the clock tower, it&#039;s clear that Shirogane wants to make this confession work, regardless of the results. It&#039;s ridiculous work, but it&#039;s all worth it just to migrate to Stanford and live their life together.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry Maki, I understand how it means to be alone on the wayside. And Iino&#039;s so dedicated to her work, she forgot about having fun, and lucky for her, Ishigami gave that entertainment to her. It&#039;s damn impressive to have Season 1&#039;s ED come back as Kaguya gave the one thing that she can give to him: the eventual kiss of feeling pents up in the heart for this long. It&#039;s an amazing kiss that manga readers and anime-onlies have been waiting like forever!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry Kaguya, a kiss doesn&#039;t mean that you&#039;re on fire correctly, but at least it&#039;s a confession game that rewards everyone up to this point.<br />
<br />

"FICTION HAS JUST PEAKED<br />
<br />
Perfection has been reached. The highest of praise could not convey how perfect this confession is in my opinion, both in the manga, and now in the anime. How everything is set up feels just right, every little detail is necessary, and meaningful to the progression of the narrative. I find myself smiling, laughing, and even tearing up&mdash;all within the span of like 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Both ambitious and subtle, built up just as well as concluded. What Kaguya-sama presents here is a true masterclass of the romance/comedy genre, and there is to this day no confession scene/arc as well planned out and executed as this, that I am aware of. It is so flawless, so incredibly climactic and satisfying. Everything comes together. <br />
<br />
I love this part of the manga beoynd reason, and I really couldn&rsquo;t have ever imagined a better way to adapt it than this. To me, this is one of the greatest examples of manga adaptation done right in all of anime. Everyone who worked on this, from the vas, to the animators, to the director, composer, etc really gave this their all, their passion, talent and utmost care. I couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful to A-1 for giving Kaguya-sama the greatest possible adaptation, which it absolutely deserves. Finally a manga adaptation truly lives up to the hype of its source material. <br />
<br />

Hands down BEST romcom ever. And easily he best confession of all time.,hands best romcom ever easily best confession time
"Idk if this is the best anime episode ever created but it&#039;s certainly up there among the best. Especially in romcoms. This hour-long special exceeded all of my expectations. Not exaggerating. <br />
<br />
After 3 seasons they finally confessed. And it was glorious. This whole season feels like a step up from the last 2 seasons. Was the animation in Kaguya-sama always this good? I guess I&#039;ll need to rewatch the last 2 seasons. From the clips I&#039;ve seen they seem to have a very good dub so that&#039;s a good reason to revisit this anime. <br />
<br />
I never thought I&#039;d enjoy this anime this much back when I started watching it for the first time in 2020. It feels so long ago now. The wait was worth it. I hope the wait for the next seasons will also be worth it. And I also can&#039;t wait for the &quot;Oshi no Ko&quot; anime.

"I read from Twitter about Ep12 a week ago and thought it&#039;s gonna be a 1 hour long episode, but my thought is wrong, on BiliBili they separate Ep12 into 2 episodes, but still count as long episode if we mix them up, even it&#039;s not accurately 1 hour long but like 50 minutes I guess.<br />
<br />
Finally this season is ended, I hope there is Season 4 on the next spring hahah, everyone need more Kaguya, so please do more Kaguya A-1 Picture-san or the Director-san whatever, I hope the team cover all manga chapter like usual www.<br />
<br />
You know, I&#039;m really glad that they finally confess each other, even do a kiss, but a bit confused about the confession, it is Kaguya or Shirogane confessing first? Also I hope they understand that after confess they need to dating lol.<br />
<br />
Shirogane and Kaguya, Omedeto Gozaimasu! You two are officially a couple after a long time, I almost thought that her love just ended like that after Shirogane tell her that he will move to Stanford, Shirogane moving to Stanford? Woah that a big achievement! After the end of Ep13, I&#039;m happy to see that Shirogane wish and ask Kaguya if she follow him going to Stanford too, I hope Stanford choosing her, it&#039;s Kaguya so, there is 99.99% that Kaguya getting to Stanford uwu.<br />
<br />
Hayasaka! I love her embarrassing and shocked face hahah, when she get know that Shirogane and Kaguya is above Big Clock Town, no, this scene is even interesting, Kaguya tell Hayasaka about how she&#039;s feel when kissing with someone she loved, that embarrassing face... Doshitano... Kawaii Koto... LOL! After that Hayasaka herself admit that Kaguya is Baka, but she glad that Kaguya finally stop keep her feeling and finally she freeing her feeling already, very cool confession, anyone will agree hahah.<br />
<br />
This Episode is very Ultra Romantic, they confess, they kiss, yesss, Shirogane making an Ultra Romantic mode, he doing like present to Kaguya for her confession or maybe he confess her first but I support Shirogane lol, but no that&#039;s not count as gift, but the real gift is.... Uwuuuuu they kissed, they&#039;re really kissed, for real lmao, this feel like not just present for Kaguya but also for us!!<br />
<br />
Oh no, I didn&#039;t realize that I am already write an essay hahah, by the way, I will give all my support to this show so I am very hope that the team will making 4th Season on next Spring.<br />
<br />
Ok we forgot about Fujiwara, she&#039;s kinda adorable and sometimes broke my humor with her acting hahah, I support you Fujiwara-san, I hope you have love feeling to someone like other too, not just become a clown in this show hahah.<br />

Then Shirogane and Kaguya kissed that symbolized their feeling of love to each other. And Shirogane offer to Kaguya that he invites her to study with him at Stanford.

This episode was a complete masterpiece !,episode complete masterpiece !
"I watched it in the wrong order :(<br />
When I went to watch it I watched part 2 before part 1 but It did not ruin it for me. I just watched part 1 then rewatched part 2. ok time for my review.<br />
<br />
10000000000000000000/10 episode! <br />
This episode is one I have been waiting for for sooooooo long. I had a amazing experience since I rewatched the whole show during the week while waiting for this episode.<br />
<br />
The animation was amazing this episode and many things looked really stunning.<br />
<br />
The music was amazing!! I love the use of the first ED by Halca (my personal favourite ED from the show) it was amazing to hear it again! The music was really done well and it made scenes even more emotional.<br />
<br />
Okay now to the scene I have been waiting to talk about which is the kiss scene. This scene was one of the best if not THE BEST confession/kiss in all romance anime I&#039;ve seen. I love the buildup to it and I love how amazing Shirogane was when he was on the tower. Playing Sentimental Crisis while leading up to the kiss was perfect.

"So this aired as an hour in Japan huh? But both episodes had the opening and ending themes which leads me to believe this should probably be listed as 13 episodes on MAL but...I dunno. Well I&#039;ll treat this as the final episode and give my thoughts here either way:<br />
<br />
Ah yes, the apex of the plot to this point arrives at last. It&#039;s a good feeling, but also a bittersweet one. All throughout this season, another very strong one like the others, I knew it would be coming. But it&#039;s what&#039;s next that concerns me. I started reading Kaguya before it made the switch to a weekly publication, but shortly after this arc ended I put it on hold, fearing what might be coming next would be a downgrade in quality. Sadly, many of the comments I&#039;ve read since would seem to indicate that is the case. And so with the announcement of another series today I&#039;m left wondering if I shouldn&#039;t just end my Kaguya journey here, happy and satisfied with this strong 8/10 level series. I can&#039;t say for sure right now either way, but I guess we&#039;ll see, someday evetually.",aired hour japan huh episodes opening ending themes leads believe probably listed 13 episodes mal dunno well 039 treat final episode give thoughts either way ah yes apex plot point arrives last 039 good feeling also bittersweet one throughout season another strong one like others knew would coming 039 039 next concerns started reading kaguya made switch weekly publication shortly arc ended put hold fearing might coming next would downgrade quality sadly many comments 039 read since would seem indicate case announcement another series today 039 left wondering 039 end kaguya journey happy satisfied strong 8 10 level series 039 say sure right either way guess 039 see someday evetually

"In the end, it wasn&#039;t so much that the person who confessed first was the loser so much as that both individuals wanted to be confessed to and feel validated that the person they love more than anything loves them back and that they were worthy to be loved by them.<br />
<br />
Shirogane really put this whole plot together since early in the season, constructing ways to take care of the supporting cast, get everything ready and in its right position, and even enlisting Momo and the principal for help. Shirogane wasn&#039;t really going to leave Kaguya behind, he wanted her to come to Stanford with him. And now Kaguya has something to strive toward, even going up against her family, other than confessing to Shirogane...being with him for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
Sucks for Iino that she didn&#039;t get to see the campfire when she worked so hard for it, even if she&#039;s happy other people get to enjoy it. Luckily Ishigami is nice enough to bring the campfire to her, even giving her a heart to boot.<br />
<br />
Maki wants all happy couples to burn to cinders, although ironically the girl who stole the guy she liked ends up liking her more than said boyfriend.<br />
<br />
What are the chances that Fujiwara on a wild goose chase would stumble into a secret room that let Karen witness the whole game? And she&#039;s so touched she speaks from the Gospel of Luke at something so momentous and amazing.<br />
<br />
Who needs to just give one Heart to your lady when you can give her all the hearts. Which says a lot even without words, just as Kaguya&#039;s kiss amidst the montage of the supporting cast and her relationship with Shirogane amidst the season 1 Ending. And it was truly beautiful.<br />
<br />
So...the two didn&#039;t actually confess even if they conveyed their feelings all the same (but Kaguya still wants to be confessed too, title drop for the win), and Shirogane is still feeling the heat from that kiss. Meanwhile Kaguya has descended into BakaKaguya and Hayasaka is a bashful maiden asking about a kiss while Kaguya learned to use casually use tongue from Kashiwagi and Tsubasa. No wonder Shirogane can&#039;t forget about that kiss.<br />

Every single second of this 1-hour finale was such a joy to watch with a good amount of screen time given to the sub plots such as Ishigami&#039;s relationship with Tsubame and Maki&#039;s dilemma but not at all taking away from the main event of the main couple&#039;s confession at the top of the clock tower, far above anyone else. The creators making how the confession was going to play be so unpredictable to the audience was such a good touch and definitely enhanced the enjoyment of one of the indubitably best anime episode&#039;s of all time. I know perfection does not exist but this is incredibly close to it.<br />

This is the best episode to air like, ever on TV. This is what we called peak perfection of TV. I have never seen an episode that I have willingly read 15 times prior to this (I love the festival arc way too much) then watch those 2 episodes that aired back-to-back to savour the enjoyment of how perfect this is.<br />
<br />
The music AWWWWWWWWWWWW MAN is it incredible, I love the cutins that they added, the pacing was perfect, switching at the best possible times between 136 and 137, the narrator doing god&#039;s work and just everything that they added just added already to the peek perfection that already was the peak that was the manga. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think Television will ever hit the same high to me anymore... it&#039;s quite sad that this had to air when I was 17, I suppose life does have to go downhill somewhere. <br />

I cannot wait to see how they justify the very last scene in the anime in the next season/movie, probably some tiein that cuts them back to 139.

Honestly tho, everything is just perfect. Tsubame-Ishigami subplot is damn cute, it worked very well for Ishigami too, so well that it didnt interrupts main couple game. All the build-ups are great too, knowing everyone involved would help Shirogane for all these things.<br />
<br />
And oh the kiss! Lmao Kaguya innocently doing french kiss in the heat of the moment, very Bakaguya.<br />
<br />
Another thing i liked from this finale episode is when Ishigami comforts Iino, man no need to drop her big fucking love bomb.<br />
<br />
Perfection &infin;/5",oh lord! else perfection could describe witnessed man shirogane little game far entertaining anime reactions casuals fujiwara added lot comedy honestly tho everything perfect tsubame ishigami subplot damn cute worked well ishigami well didnt interrupts main couple game build ups great knowing everyone involved would help shirogane things oh kiss! lmao kaguya innocently french kiss heat moment bakaguya another thing liked finale episode ishigami comforts iino man need drop big fucking love bomb perfection infin 5

"I am so sorry. This anime really could have been the perfect romantic comedy anime or even ultra-romantic. Which would have been so if they hadn&#039;t skipped minor details in the finale.<br />
<br />
First of all, they constantly interrupted the kissing scene. They could have shown all the intervening episodes later, which they should have. In the manga, this chapter was already excellent and they shouldn&#039;t have pushed it further.<br />
<br />
Also, please compare Iino Miko&#039;s looking at the heart scene by Ishigami with a manga. Both the display order and the drawing are very bad. A-1 Studio did not want to reflect Iino&#039;s feelings, or they could not. That&#039;s where this season&#039;s alleged Ultra Romanticism was all about. The manga took the concept of Dual Confession to a new dimension, but unfortunately the anime studio couldn&#039;t understand it.<br />
<br />
I am really disappointed. It was going great until the finale, but simple mistakes made kept the series from being perfect. Personally, I really like the rest of the manga from this point. I hope A-1 Studio does not repeat these mistakes in future seasons and we can watch a perfect fourth season. My rating for this season is 9/10",sorry anime really could perfect romantic comedy anime even ultra romantic would 039 skipped minor details finale first constantly interrupted kissing scene could shown intervening episodes later manga chapter already excellent 039 pushed also please compare iino miko 039 looking heart scene ishigami manga display order drawing bad 1 studio want reflect iino 039 feelings could 039 season 039 alleged ultra romanticism manga took concept dual confession new dimension unfortunately anime studio 039 understand really disappointed going great finale simple mistakes made kept series perfect personally really like rest manga point hope 1 studio repeat mistakes future seasons watch perfect fourth season rating season 9 10

"WOW. I absolutely loved this episode. Shirogane&#039;s way of confessing (well &quot;confessing&quot;) to Shinomiya was simply amazing.

Can&#039;t wait to see where this story goes!",wow absolutely loved episode shirogane 039 way confessing well quot confessing quot shinomiya simply amazing episode heart pounding made absolute happiest 039 wait see story goes!
"Can&#039;t believe it&#039;s over. The final ep really wrapped things up well; I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s over (cause I really hope it isn&#039;t) but the way Miyuki planned everything out to lead to them kissing was the best.<br />
I&#039;m not sure what I was expecting, coming into the final 2 episodes but I thought there&#039;d at least be some kind of confession but both of them going to Stanford isn&#039;t a bad path either.<br />
I guess you could say that the main story&#039;s over and it&#039;s peaked but we&#039;ve still got a lot to see; for starters, I saw the cherry blossom at the end which means that Tsubame-senpai should have given Ishigami her response. Not that I&#039;m desperate, but if I could have more, I wouldn&#039;t decline it.<br />
Overall, I loved the series and think that the mangaka has done great. 10/10 overall because I loved the characters from start to end (yes, I&#039;m biased).<br />
Thanks for the enjoyment.",039 believe 039 final ep really wrapped things well 039 saying 039 cause really hope 039 way miyuki planned everything lead kissing best 039 sure expecting coming final episodes thought 039 least kind confession going stanford 039 bad path either guess could say main story 039 039 peaked 039 still got lot see starters saw cherry blossom end means tsubame senpai given ishigami response 039 desperate could 039 decline overall loved series think mangaka done great 10 10 overall loved characters start end yes 039 biased thanks enjoyment
in the end it is a childish anime. so disappointing. they censored the kissing scene by covering it with a blue baloon,end childish anime disappointing censored kissing scene covering blue baloon
"That was a masterful confession, I knew it would happen but I had no idea how it would happen, but I loved it, I had no doubt it would be amazing even with all the manga reader hype. Shirogane&rsquo;s expertly crafted plan was a spectacle to see, it all came together so perfectly, and I love how he mainly accounted for Fujiwara ruining it lol, but thankfully it didn&rsquo;t happen and we got that big smooch, it&rsquo;s been 3 years in the making and we finally got it. It was awesome. And playing Season 1&rsquo;s ED during it was an amazing decision, that ED has always been a favorite of mine and it fit so well here. The aftermath was also hilarious with how Kaguya described it, and Hayasaka&rsquo;s reactions were so good lol, she managed to stay best girl in the episode about the confession (that&rsquo;s also just bias tho lol).<br />
<br />
And of course I would have loved to see Ishigami win Tsubame but he sadly didn&rsquo;t realize he confessed all the way to the end, even when he learned about the heart thing he didn&rsquo;t realize the impact of it, but I did really like the scene between him and Tsubame, as well as the Iino scene. I know they&rsquo;re shipping him with both girls so he&rsquo;s kinda guaranteed to win one of them, but personally I&rsquo;d love to see Tsubame get with him, but only time will tell on that one.<br />
<br />
And with that we find ourselves at the end of another season of Kaguya-sama, I can&rsquo;t say a whole lot besides it was amazing Kaguya goodness once again, with the added satisfaction of the confession it made for a perfect follow-up to the already 10/10 Season 2. I really loved seeing all these characters again as well as some new ones, I can only hope for a 4th season which I don&rsquo;t doubt is a possibility, it would also be really cool to see a world post confession. But for now, I&rsquo;ll relish in the ending of this fantastic 3rd season of this fantastic anime series. And certainly last but not least, the OP and ED were both once again bangers, the OP falling right along with the first two with our favorite &ldquo;King of Love Songs&rdquo; himself, and a super fitting ED which will ring with nostalgia not long from now, complete with the amazing Starship Troopers reference.",masterful confession knew would happen idea would happen loved doubt would amazing even manga reader hype shirogane rsquo expertly crafted plan spectacle see came together perfectly love mainly accounted fujiwara ruining lol thankfully rsquo happen got big smooch rsquo 3 years making finally got awesome playing season 1 rsquo ed amazing decision ed always favorite mine fit well aftermath also hilarious kaguya described hayasaka rsquo reactions good lol managed stay best girl episode confession rsquo also bias tho lol course would loved see ishigami win tsubame sadly rsquo realize confessed way end even learned heart thing rsquo realize impact really like scene tsubame well iino scene know rsquo shipping girls rsquo kinda guaranteed win one personally rsquo love see tsubame get time tell one find end another season kaguya sama rsquo say whole lot besides amazing kaguya goodness added satisfaction confession made perfect follow already 10 10 season really loved seeing characters well new ones hope 4th season rsquo doubt possibility would also really cool see world post confession rsquo relish ending fantastic 3rd season fantastic anime series certainly last least op ed bangers op falling right along first two favorite ldquo king love songs rdquo super fitting ed ring nostalgia long complete amazing starship troopers reference

"That was... Surprisingly unsatisfying. It was great up until Kaguya started fretting over going to Stanford. Then it started feeling dragged out, but then we don&#039;t get to even see the kiss. Then they basically confirm they didn&#039;t actually confess to one another? Then there&#039;s the weird jump forward. Does Shirogane go to Stanford? What about Ishigami&#039;s confession? It&#039;s a good thing there&#039;s another season coming, because this just felt unfulfilling, despite the kiss.",surprisingly unsatisfying great kaguya started fretting going stanford started feeling dragged 039 get even see kiss basically confirm 039 actually confess one another 039 weird jump forward shirogane go stanford ishigami 039 confession 039 good thing 039 another season coming felt unfulfilling despite kiss

"Well, this season was a rollercoaster. I came into this series not really even all that interested and here, at the end of season 3, I can say it&#039;s one of my favorites now. It&#039;s really grown on me and there&#039;s been an incredible amount of development. Obviously I&#039;m already hyped for season 4.<br />
<br />
It looks like Miko isn&#039;t out of the running for Ishigami&#039;s affections. I still think they are going to be each other&#039;s endgame coupling. Especially since Tsubame is so fickle. Ishigami basically only idolizes her, and doesn&#039;t have the raw chemistry that he does with Miko. With Shirogane and Kaguya&#039;s relationship secured, my focus is on Ishigami and Miko going forward.<br />
<br />
The &quot;final&quot; confrontation with Shirogane and Kaguya was pretty amusing, and cute. Especially with all the extra stuff that was happening around them. Fujiwara miraculously solving a mystery was probably one of my favorite parts of this episode.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a 10/10 from me.",well season rollercoaster came series really even interested end season 3 say 039 one favorites 039 really grown 039 incredible amount development obviously 039 already hyped season looks like miko 039 running ishigami 039 affections still think going 039 endgame coupling especially since tsubame fickle ishigami basically idolizes 039 raw chemistry miko shirogane kaguya 039 relationship secured focus ishigami miko going forward quot final quot confrontation shirogane kaguya pretty amusing cute especially extra stuff happening around fujiwara miraculously solving mystery probably one favorite parts episode 039 10 10

"There&#039;s something off about the direction this season. So many rehashed jokes and unnecessary fillers when the title is Ultra Romantic.

It really doesn&rsquo;t get better than this. What&rsquo;s so great about this series is that it focuses on more than just the two main characters and has multiple storylines going on at once that are continually growing alongside the main pair. It&rsquo;s rare that even side characters are given so much spotlight, let alone legitimate focus for a much of the series.

Yeah, it serves the narrative, so they can use the fact that the exact kiss wasn&#039;t shown, for a fun moment. A few messages before this, Drimson posted a few pages from the manga showing how the kiss being a secret leads to a funny moment. We also saw it when Kaguya was bragging about the kiss to Hayasaka, and told her about the &quot;tongue action&quot; and Hayasaka being shocked about this boldness. While Kaguya never realized her kiss was a bit over the top",quote kinjikido message 66687609 quote dutch_chief message 66687561 quote kinjikido message 66686498 end childish anime disappointing censored kissing scene covering blue baloon quote 039 manga adapted detail scene perfectly also 039 see kiss later learn french kissed balloon would kept secret little longer also served story purpose keep us knowing really happened kaguya talks kiss realizes overdid little first kiss quote 039 read manga watch anime ok well thanks make sense manga secret quote yeah serves narrative use fact exact kiss 039 shown fun moment messages drimson posted pages manga showing kiss secret leads funny moment also saw kaguya bragging kiss hayasaka told quot tongue action quot hayasaka shocked boldness kaguya never realized kiss bit top

After 3 seasons of waiting, we&#039;ve got the moment we&#039;ve all been waiting for. A-1 pictures truly outdid themselves, a peak episode as the season finale for a peak series. I don&#039;t think it could have been any better and unfortunately I don&#039;t think it will be possible to top this.

"It took me a couple of minutes to even type this part, because honestly I can&#039;t think of what to say...I know what I feel, and if I didn&#039;t read the manga 2 years ago, I would&#039;ve had a heart attack, but yes my anime-only brethren, our lovely couple of Kaguya and Shirogane is officially official.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t need to spaz out the things that happened this episode, because I&#039;ll like to keep those already overwhelming thoughts for myself, all I can say that the 3-season buildup to that fateful scene is worth it after all. The planning that Miyuki masterminded and Shinomiya&#039;s long overdue to commitment to finally fess up finally brought them together and made for one if not the best scene from a romcom anime in the past couple of years. This confession scene is on par if not better than Sakuta&#039;s confession to Mai in Bunny Girl Senpai. Well I do have one gripe though, out of all things that can go wrong, and I know they did stay true to the manga, [b]but A1, how the hell do you still include that balloon that is in the way of their kiss[/b], I already had a bad feeling that they&#039;ll still include the balloon and they did, [b]ughhhhhh[/b].<br />
<br />
Even with that rant, I am satisfied. The reason how I got to watch the show is actually funny. I did an experiment where I&#039;ll watch Shirobako, Sakurasou and Re:Zero together and in this order I&#039;ll watch one episode, then move on to the next show, and so on until I completed them together. But since Re:Zero is 25 episodes long, I figure that I&#039;ll substitute it with this show which at the time Season 2 was finishing. And 2 years later to that day I started watching them together, with a read of the manga, and me growing up ever since then, I say that the journey was all worth it. I will not be mad if A1 ends the adaptation here, because the audience who refuse to read the manga will make up their own conclusions from hereafter.<br />
<br />
In my eyes, the circle of this show officially comes back to the start, and what a great 3-season run it has been. If I&#039;m actually serious with myself, I will give this an absolute 10/10, but for now it&#039;s a 9 just like Season 1 &amp; 2.<br />

"The hype for the finale was on a herculean scale, but I think this final episode nailed it, personally. =)<br />
<br />
It was a lot to take in, but Miyuki certainly worked his butt off in making this set-up for a confession so damn effective and memorable. Normally, the balloon that got in the way of seeing the kiss between Miyuki and Kaguya would annoy me, but for once, I didn&#039;t mind as the reactions from Karen made me burst out laughing. XD<br />
<br />
As for Ishigami, it looks like he was off-base with Tsubame, but aside from his error of not knowing about what giving someone a heart meant during the festival, his time with Tsubame was cute. I do hope we&#039;ll know what her answer will be in the future, though.<br />
<br />
As for Miko, for someone who worked so hard to make the campfire happen in the first place, the poor girl got the short end of the stick in patrolling the streets around the academy. Once again, Ishigami was kind to record everyone having fun at the campfire with his iPad and showed it to Miko. God, her reaction was so perfect, easily one of the best smiles I&#039;ve seen in a while. ^_^<br />
<br />
I&#039;m definitely will wait a little while before I&#039;ll rate this 3rd season, considering how insane the hype has been. This season had a slower start, with the usual high-grade comedy, but the latter half has been so damn amazing.

This was a fumbled ending with an unsatisfactory conclusion. There was no pay off after the confession and kiss. How did Kaguya and Shirogane act the next day? What did they talk about?

I&#039;ll be the mature one and continue to explain my reasoning. When the viewer is invested in the relationship, we expect a payoff for that investment.

Anyone can have a valid opinion on something as subjective as an anime, whether you like that opinion or not. If you need a definition for the word subjective, let me know.<br />
<br />
And I certainly hope it does go to the day after the kiss. It&#039;ll be bar none the most compelling episode yet, as we&#039;ll finally get to see how both characters react and deal with the fact they like each other. That is what the viewer is waiting to see, the development in the relationship the show is based around.<br />

Coming to the episode, it was just awesome. The comedy, the animation, music, everything was just too good. Deserves 10/10. I&#039;ve already watched episode 13 thrice and I&#039;m still not able to process it, so much happened man, Shirogane asking Kaguya to apply for Stanford was saying so much, there&#039;s so much to unpack there in those few words. And the ultra cheerful-chibi Kaguya part was cute as well as hilarious, though I didn&#039;t understand why the narrator said Kaguya messed up in the end and it&#039;s her loss?

"Honestly I don&rsquo;t even know what to say regarding the finale of this season, Its really something I can&rsquo;t explain when it comes to what makes this show so good type of question.<br />
<br />
It just works I guess, wether its the phenomenal use of pop culture references or the use of such well developed characters for situations they fit so perfectly in or the humor and comedy that always hits the mark and works.<br />
<br />
But if I had to talk about this episode in general , its masterfully done to say the absolute least. This made anime history, truly one of the greatest and most memorable expierences I had pleasure of seeing in my anime journey so far. Its unbelievable how this show came in so clutch when it mattered the most, when the hype was built up they took the opportunity and nailed it.<br />

Anyone can have a valid opinion on something as subjective as an anime, whether you like that opinion or not. If you need a definition for the word subjective, let me know.<br />

It&#039;ll be bar none the most compelling episode yet, as we&#039;ll finally get to see how both characters react and deal with the fact they like each other.

"Good episode. Shirogane making a heart balloon while facing it to Kaguya was adorable. Tsubame is having a hard to returning her feelings to Ishigami and to the manga readers: try not to spoil  challenge, when they were observing Chika and Miko getting confessed/hit on was truly something. Chika was so smart though, she played her own games and if they didn&rsquo;t get the answer right, she just proceeds to reject them. While Miko on the other hand, got Ishigami smacking her head, a good gif imo. The fortune-teller segment was amusing af and the moment Ishigami turned into some kind of zombie had a direction which gave me a CCTV moment. Also, Hayasaka had another character inserted song. The Standford dilemma is again for manga readers: try not to spoil challenge because it&rsquo;ll play quite a role for Shirogane&#039;s character in the latter.<br />

"We can see all during this episode how much more serious Shirogane is. He knows that clock is ticking and almost out of time. Trying to make the most of this culture festival, cool as a cucumber when Kaguya sat down for her balloon. She worried like crazy about the optics of asking him for a heart. All for Shirogane to have the payment for a heart balloon mean exchanging hearts. Totally got one over on Kaguya all the while she thought of every way around asking and even Kashiwagi assisting. Trying to just slide Shirogane a ton of cash and run off so funny. <br />
<br />
Tsubame has a tough choice to make, she does care about Ishigami but isn&#039;t sure if its on that specific way. Tsubame is torn on what to do since she doesn&#039;t want to hurt Ishigami knowing her college she&#039;s going to will be far away. Kaguya completely misinterpreting Tsubame at the start and giving cutthroat advice to be brutal as possible. Terrible timing to flip that switch Kaguya, her immediately backtracking was hilarious. Had to try and change Tsubame mind back before she tore Ishigami heart. I like the decision Tsubame comes to, give Ishigami an answer after getting to know him better. <br />
<br />
Shirogane continuing to be completely cool even during that wacky fortune teller scene. Kaguya taking him I&#039;m there backfired big-time for her as Shirogane kept pressing the fortune teller for more predictions. It made me so happy to see the two of them spend genuine time together without the usual mind games interfering. Funny as those can be I like having our romantic leads get to just bask in each others company without worrying. A perfect day as the last day of the festival winds down. Shirogane dropping the bombshell on Kaguya right as the episode ends. She doesn&#039;t have as much time left with him as she thought.

Also a decent amount of development for the sub plot of Ishigami&#039;s relationship with Tsubame.

On the Ishigami front looks like Tsubame&#039;s on full avoid mode. Tsubame though really has a ton of things to worry about when it comes to relationships though. Chika&#039;s way of dealing with confessions by confusing the hell out of them sure was unique. That fortune teller really was unique. But Kaguya sure had quite a lot of saves when trying to progress with her plan. The switching scenes for Yu and Miko&#039;s entrances were really well done.

The Shuchiin Hoshin Culture Fesival continued, and Kaguya continues her feigned ignorance on Shirogane, who&#039;s still mastering balloon art. And making a heart balloon with the cost being a heart, Kaguya&#039;s about to burst right now...<br />
<br />
As for Tsubame, she&#039;s definitely avoiding Ishigami due to the high-profile confession, and she&#039;s thinking of turning him down nicely, that Kaguya misinterpreted her situation and dug her own grave lols.

Continuing Kaguya and Shirogane&#039;s confession game, while many people saw it as a date, it just that and more than just a secret tryst. And getting their fortune told, it&#039;s more like their future already foretold for them, but only left to circumstances to actually trigger their love onfession.

Such a depressing news for Shinomiya after having such a blast with Kaicho. All that fun she had, all that luck she had was just to prepare her for what was going to come next. Man I have no idea how Kaguya&#039;s gonna handle this news, is she gonna get desperate and confess so that they can at least spend the remaining school year together or will she close her heart off and become ice princess again to avoid any more pain? And just one more episode left AAAAAAAA fuck.<br />
<br />
Things aren&#039;t looking too bad for Yuu though, if I had to guess I think Tsubme&#039;s gonna decide on getting to know Yuu more, she more or less confirmed that it&#039;s not gonna be an outright rejection, good for Yu.<br />

"This episode did a nice job with the Take On Me and Resident Evil references. =)<br />
<br />
Chika has gone into full detective mode and is focusing hard on catching the phantom thief. When the brave boy went to confess to her, the way she rejected him in a form of a quiz was rather amusing, but at least he took her rejection well. That, and how Miko had to be saved by Ishigami when she was hit on by two guys, happened when Kaguya and Tsubame were talking about what answer she wants to tell Ishigami after his move last week. I can only hope that Ishigami will be satisfied with her answer, regardless of the outcome.<br />
<br />
After that, Miyuki asked Kaguya to hang out with him to enjoy the festival itself, which was rather cute and funny, especially with the visit to the fortune telling booth. However, after they both got back to the council room, Miyuki finally told Kaguya that after the end of his second year, he&#039;ll be leaving the school so he can study abroad at Stanford.<br />
<br />
A perfect way to end the episode on a cliffhanger. I&#039;m also glad that the final episode will be a double-length episode as well, so I highly look forward to seeing how things will go for everyone.",episode nice job take resident evil references chika gone full detective mode focusing hard catching phantom thief brave boy went confess way rejected form quiz rather amusing least took rejection well miko saved ishigami hit two guys happened kaguya tsubame talking answer wants tell ishigami move last week hope ishigami satisfied answer regardless outcome miyuki asked kaguya hang enjoy festival rather cute funny especially visit fortune telling booth however got back council room miyuki finally told kaguya end second year 039 leaving school study abroad stanford perfect way end episode cliffhanger 039 also glad final episode double length episode well highly look forward seeing things go everyone

"Some great references this episode, &quot;Take on Me&quot; and I think what was a reference to [i]Resident Evil[/i]?<br />
<br />
I thought we would learn more about the thief but the only main new lead was the reference to clocks, like in the intro. I don&#039;t mind though because that isn&#039;t even close to the main event.<br />
<br />
Kaguya beating around the bush for a heart, when they were talking about prices I was wondering what she couldn&#039;t possibly afford. I&#039;m a little annoyed at her, that was a perfect time to give it to  him.<br />
<br />
Shinomiya screwing over Ishigami without realizing it was great, she only had best intentions in mind (well I guess it was mainly so she could also confess but intially she seemed more concerned with striking out any competition). Chika getting rid of her interest was entertaining, especially the way Shinomiya covered Tsubame&#039;s eyes afterwards. Lino and her guys was funny too, exactly the thing she had been dreaming of only for Ishigami to shoo her away from them. I feel like once she learns more about Ishigami she is sure to accept.<br />
<br />
Oooh boy the culture festival date. That was nice, luck really was on her side this time. I found it funny, it basically was a reminder of how they got screwed over every other time. Once all the normal obstacles were out of the way though Shirgoane had to drop that bombshell on her. Really brought down my mood, that&#039;s for sure.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m still excited for the hour long episode tomorrow though! I just have to know what happens! This episode was good buildup (along with being a good episode) and I&#039;m sure the finale will be spectacular.<br />

"The longer the festival goes the more i feel Kaguya&#039;s mental deteriorate. Unsuspecting wing women Kashiwagi coming in for Kaguya after Shirogane check-mates her with the hearts, however Kaguya&#039;s glass cannon mode fully kicks in for what seems to be the rest of the episode. Seeing the other side of Kaguya is truly something. I mean in general comparing her now to s1 is like night and day. Didn&#039;t help that Shirogane was being very upfront, probably due to the fact that he had his future on his mind and was just creating some small talk for build up, otherwise i would of thought he suddenly grew even larger balls of steel. But as a good cliffhanger we see him hand an unknowing and love struck Kaguya the approval forms.<br />

Kaguya actually gutting Ishigami with that misinterpretation between him and Tsubame. Nice to see that Kaguya does want this to be a success for Ishigami, not just because it suits her needs, but also because she&#039;s just a genuinely good friend at heart. Well i guess its good that she at least realized what was happening after unknowingly digging Ishigami&#039;s grave for like 10 mins, could practically feel the cold feet Kaguya got after realizing her mistake.<br />

I just love Fujiwara&#039;s reactions in this episode.,love fujiwara 039 reactions episode
"Chika who has been noticeably absent mostly during the previous culture festival episodes now has a full episode in the front seat before we get to the serious stuff at the end of the festival. Chika and the games club president both basically torturing poor Iino to get those sounds for the haunted house. Kozue the games club president way above what needed to be done to get those sounds recorded. Iino having to do retakes with duct tape on so she wouldn&#039;t scream, my god that&#039;s terrifying and hilarious. Splitting it up between the traditional walkthrough haunted house and then a fully audio submerged experience. Kaguya and Maki were flipping out it was hilarious seeing how they reacted. Kaguya trying to act high and mighty but can&#039;t help to hold Maki hand getting scared. Closed in that locker blindfolded having that crazy sounds played to them. <br />
<br />
Chika later trying to get her little sister to stop crushing on Shirogane. If anyone has seen him in less favorable situations its Chika. Helping him all those times with his crazy ineptitude, now suddenly he can juggle and perform with those strong toys so easily. Chika little sister falling deeper in love with Shirogane. It was funny seeing Kaguya switch from murder mode to giggling with Moeka after she heard her say the same likable things about Shirogane. <br />
<br />
Ishigami shooting his shoot with Tsubame giving her the giant heart cookie. The symbolism of giving someone a heart at the festival. Tsubame didn&#039;t immediately say no which I take as a good sign but its still up in the air. Ishigami has done all he can for now. Shirogane heavily invested in how well Ishigami does with that confession since a rejection would kill the mood. Night is falling on the first day as the bonfire will soon commence, where did all the balloons go.

Ishigami&rsquo;s confession was hella smooth. If she doesn&rsquo;t say yes now then it was never gonna happen. More Shirogane and Chika time is always great.

Ishigami took a gut punch after Miko erupted because of crimps in the locker and separated him and Tsubame. No worries, he was on the horse and presented a big cookie heart to his chosen one while not thinking one bit about the meaning of this gesture.

"Poor Miko had to be the test dummy for making the horror project work so damn well. The reactions from her, as well as Maki and Kaguya within the binaural audio locker, was funny as hell. Thanks to a certain couple deciding to make out, Miko lost it and made males and females line up separately. Ishigami&#039;s closed room plans with Tsubame didn&#039;t happen and his reaction was bloody hilarious! XD<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Chika&#039;s younger sister, Moeka, came to visit and she made no hesitation in showing how much of a crush she had for Miyuki. Despite Chika&#039;s plans to put Miyuki in a bad light, he proved her wrong witb his skills, which only made Moeka fall in love with him even more. Kaguya was not amused by it at first, but she came around to like Moeka after agreeing with her reasons for liking Miyuki. Great minds think alike, huh?<br />
<br />
Later on, Ishigami, without realising it, did one hell of a chad move and confessed to Tsubame after winning the giant heart cookie.

"What a stellar episode. My mouth is always agape from joy and excitement watching this show.<br />
<br />
The fuckin&#039; haunted house, I love scared Shinomiya and Maki, the way they made the sound for the 3D section man (she went to town on those ears like she was snacking oh my god). Poor Ishigami getting screwed over by the lovebirds.<br />
<br />
The Fujiwara sisters seeing Shirogane, I did criticize the &quot;President is bad at something miscellaneous&quot; and I was ok with it going that way this time to screw with the younger sister and when it showed him slamming the ball straight into his face I found it funny this time. Only to realize he could do everything perfect and the younger one became more and more infatuated was hilarious. Kaguya showing up at the end too with those fucking faces and realizing she found a kinship with the younger sister, writing curse on the floor as she joined her in her love. That was top notch.<br />
<br />
[spoiler=&quot;Fantastic Line btw&quot;][img]https://i.imgur.com/qAYGvXX.png[/img][/spoiler]<br />
Ishigami not knowing what the heart meant, the friends having a heart to heart about Ishigami. I really hope he doesn&#039;t fail, some because Shirogane is riding on this confession too but mostly because him being completely clueless about the gravity of gifting a heart is so funny to me. The man has no idea he 100% confessed, I want the reality to him in a good way with her accepting rather than realizing he confessed and left broken hearted.<br />

"I guess one thing that runs in the family between Maki and Kaguya would be fear of horror and hypersensitive hearing. The idea of surround sound horror experience was quite clever and something i&#039;d never ever want to experience in my life, poor Iino being the test dummy and going through one of the most painful ASMR experiences of her life.<br />
<br />
Just like that the Shirogane harem gains another member, and thus another name is added to Kaguya&#039;s list.  Don&#039;t ask how but Kaguya materializing behind Moeha made me jump.

My prayers go out to Ishigami. Who knows, maybe ignorance of not knowing cultures in festivals is what lands him with this W.<br />

"Well that&rsquo;s not the kind of haunted house you see anywhere, Kozue Makihara sure likes to have fun in the haunted house attraction that&#039;s a collaboration between Class 1-A and 1-B: Chokiko&#039;s House.

Ishigami bringing Tsubame to Chokiko&#039;s House, and due to some illicit couple making out in the locker, boys and girls were separated so now he has no chance of being alone together in the locker with her...<br />
<br />
Chika&#039;s little sister Moeha sure has a crush on Shirogane, but Chika having fully known whom he is who sucks at everything, the younger sister sure doesn&#039;t mind someone whom falters, even if given a chance. Chika wanting to unmask the Shirogane to let Moeha see the real him, and juggling...definitely is something that he can do lols, it runs in the family. Chika earning huge L&#039;s for everything lost about Shirogane, but Moeha earned a W anyways with that hug save. Of course, how would this evade Kaguya&#039;s sight to stop her at the most opportune...but it seems that Moeha has a better understanding of Shirogane than Kaguya. Earning brownie points for sharing about the same crush...<br />
<br />
But the highlight indeed was Ishigami&rsquo;s oblivious confession. oh boy he doesn&rsquo;t even know the actual magnitude of deed he just, without realizing did. So bold to give her a heart for a public confession (when he actually meant the other)...<br />

<br />
It&#039;s a shame that Ishigami and Tsubame didn&#039;t get to spend time together in one of those lockers at the horror house. Maybe had his confession taken place there, the result would have been the same, but the embarrassment of everyone else seeing it would be non-existent. But all is well that ends well, so I hope they end up dating even if the chance is slight!<br />
<br />
Also, Kaguya proved once again that there is a thin line between hate and love, this time with Chika&#039;s younger sister, Moeha, who has fallen for Shirogane (much to Chika&#039;s distress). Although Kaguya quickly realized she doesn&#039;t need to worry about a competitor because Moeha is just a middle-schooler who doesn&#039;t seem to have a chance at dating Shirogane.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, and now that Chika herself brought it up, she seems meaner than in the earlier seasons. Is it because of Kaguya that that&#039;s happened?

In a way the stakes for both are equally high this time around. The insight into how Miyuki and Kaguya were like when they first started was pretty insightful. Both look so different back then. In the past the academy sure had a different air about it. But wow Kaguya really rocked her outfit at the cosplay caf&eacute; event. To think that Kaguya would encounter experts during her shift here though. Glad that she was able to prove to them her skills at teamaking though. Maki&#039;s sure dipping into her own experiences when advising Ishigami. Miss Mood swings is a pretty apt name for Maki.

"The fabled Hoshin Shuchiin Culture Festival, let all of what happened in previous years take hold of everyone with new wineskin.<br />
<br />
The backstory of how Kaguya and Shirogane first met in the Spring of their 1st Year, the typical average latter bearing hatred for the filthy rich, the one prominent figure being Kaguya herself, the Ice Princess. And Shirogane for one, roped into the Student Council in his shrouded unnervingness, was taken aback by Kaguya&#039;s nonchalance (that in fact is still connected to the world of the rich), and became the man he is today.<br />
<br />
Kaguya&#039;s culture festival with the class cosplay caf&eacute;, and Hayasaka made NO attempts to hide her true maid origins in Kaguya&#039;s family, which is absurd lols. And even Kaguya in her Taisho-era cosplay is alluring for all the boys and some middle-aged men to collude on coffee, taste, serving and above all on the Golden Ratio. These ramen king men are hilarious LOLS.<br />
<br />
Ishigami&#039;s culture festival to stalk Tsubame all the way through, and Maki has to interfere with his antics for relationship gossip since she lost her best friend Nagisa to Tsubasa, knowning the hurt fully too well. Both truly are the epitome of a lovey-dovey relationship and poor Miss Mood Swings is still trying for an effort between them, such a nice person to give Ishigami pointers.<br />

"Some quick backstory before we get into the culture festival proper. Shirogane back in his first year at the school didn&#039;t have a great time starting out. We&#039;ve seen other flashbacks to this time period but now we see the beginning of the beginning. We see hoe Shirogane was stricken by love seeing Kaguya dive into that grimy pond to save that other student. Admiring her bravery and willingness to jump into without hesitations unlike himself. How those admirable qualities shined and prove the Shirogane fell in love first. His was a quick love while Kaguya took some time to come around. Jumping back to modern day they&#039;re both standing ready to confess at this culture festival. Kaguya at her class&#039;s maid cafe was hilarious. The ramen guys of all people coming to check it out. They&#039;ve been in awe of Chika in previous seasons but now its Hayasaka who&#039;s coffee skills are to be admired. Kaguya not to be outdone had to show she can make good tea if not coffee. Making a tea filled with the flavors of love after she noticed Shirogane enter the cafe. Both of our leads are such on edge during this culture festival. Ishigami is not in the best spot either. Wanting to wake Tsubame out but petrified by the idea of rejection, sounds familiar, looking for that perfect moment to swoop in and ask her. Maki does offer some nice advice even if to her own detriment per usual. Very happy that Tsubame agreed to go to the haunted house with Ishigami. So far things for everyone are going smoothly.",quick backstory get culture festival proper shirogane back first year school 039 great time starting 039 seen flashbacks time period see beginning beginning see hoe shirogane stricken love seeing kaguya dive grimy pond save student admiring bravery willingness jump without hesitations unlike admirable qualities shined prove shirogane fell love first quick love kaguya took time come around jumping back modern day 039 standing ready confess culture festival kaguya class 039 maid cafe hilarious ramen guys people coming check 039 awe chika previous seasons hayasaka 039 coffee skills admired kaguya outdone show make good tea coffee making tea filled flavors love noticed shirogane enter cafe leads edge culture festival ishigami best spot either wanting wake tsubame petrified idea rejection sounds familiar looking perfect moment swoop ask maki offer nice advice even detriment per usual happy tsubame agreed go haunted house ishigami far things everyone going smoothly

"Before I forget about it, that scene when Nagisa suggests to Tsubasa that they too should go to The Horror House, Maki breaks inside and somehow a [b]right triangle[/b] shows to her face, signifying that she&#039;s just a third fiddle for the three of them. I just point it out since it&#039;s a shape and all....<br />
<br />
Anyways, this episode is a banger. I finally get to see the flashback story animated and I never thought the old SC president has a purple hair in him, but hey he did pushed our boy Miyuki to become the President as he graduates. Miyuki and Kaguya were different just over a year ago, with our boy having no golden chain yet and pretty much defeated because of this school&#039;s status, and Kaguya being a total Ice Princess, only thinking about ulterior motives and a severe lack of emotions. Even with how she is, something inside Miyuki blossomed which led him losing the fight all those time ago, and right now he&#039;s fully prepared to make the move.<br />
<br />
Ramen King is back along with his other Ramen King bro, and yeah when Hayasaka dissed on Kaguya with that scene they were making, I thought it&#039;s Shit on Kaguya day but she proved them wrong with just a cup of tea...mission successful...ly failed, it turned into a worse scene. Kaguya&#039;s blush was all around her face but Miyuki does love the tea as well, I&#039;m sure that Ramen King is right with his critical assessment of &quot;love&quot;. And even with all that buzz, I was laughing so hard when Daddy Dio appeared at the front of her face, top that with Aoi Koga&#039;s shriek, top notch comedy.<br />
<br />
Then the last scene where our boy Ishigami fails at first but successfully convinces Tsubame to hang out with him. I love the fact that even if it fails, he has Maki to go around with in school, knowing the fact that she&#039;ll be stuck with Nagisa and Tsubasa all day long. And though Ishigami was successful on asking her out, I just feel the worrying vibes from Tsubame, does she truly care about him or she&#039;s still putting up an act. I think I know since I read the manga, but for now I&#039;ll let it pass. Lastly, the show turned horror for a brief moment with that messed up audio and with that filter that looks like a found footage, I wonder what some other people are up to behind the scenes.",forget scene nagisa suggests tsubasa go horror house maki breaks inside somehow b right triangle b shows face signifying 039 third fiddle three point since 039 shape anyways episode banger finally get see flashback story animated never thought old sc president purple hair hey pushed boy miyuki become president graduates miyuki kaguya different year ago boy golden chain yet pretty much defeated school 039 status kaguya total ice princess thinking ulterior motives severe lack emotions even something inside miyuki blossomed led losing fight time ago right 039 fully prepared make move ramen king back along ramen king bro yeah hayasaka dissed kaguya scene making thought 039 shit kaguya day proved wrong cup tea mission successful ly failed turned worse scene kaguya 039 blush around face miyuki love tea well 039 sure ramen king right critical assessment quot love quot even buzz laughing hard daddy dio appeared front face top aoi koga 039 shriek top notch comedy last scene boy ishigami fails first successfully convinces tsubame hang love fact even fails maki go around school knowing fact 039 stuck nagisa tsubasa day long though ishigami successful asking feel worrying vibes tsubame truly care 039 still putting act think know since read manga 039 let pass lastly show turned horror brief moment messed audio filter looks like found footage wonder people behind scenes

"Thank god they adapted Chapter 121 which is essential for Kaguya and Shirogane&#039;s development and is the former student council president voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki? I can literally recognize his voice and it suits him nicely. Also, Kaguya is so gorgeous when saving a girl who is in the pool of unsanitized substances. The cultural festival is in progress and making a drink is no easy thing with precision. I like how Maki is getting more prominent as the season progresses and she&#039;s the literal wingwoman mhm. Also, Hayasaka is cute yep. <br />

So if next episode covers full day 2 then episode 11-12 would be the confession I think[/spoiler]<br />

I was aware that people were upset because a certain chapter 121 was not adapted in last week&#039;s episode- and now that it has been shown here, I understand why. We see the reason as to what made Shirogane fall for Kaguya- and it&#039;s nothing random at all. Through one bold and selfless act, Shirogane immediately recognized the beauty hiding underneath the ice queen&#039;s cold exterior. No, it wasn&#039;t because of something like &quot;she&#039;s cute!&quot; Shirogane, a true man, fell in love with Kaguya&#039;s character herself, a character that seemingly no one had eyes open enough to see.<br />

"I really enjoyed the flashback with Miyuki and what he was like when he first joined Shuuchin Academy. His distaste with the noble students was pretty high, but you have to respect the student council president of that time which helped Miyuki when he needed it the most. Not only that, but it was the first time he really paid full attention to Kaguya, so showed no hesitation in jumping into a swamp to save a student who got knocked into it.<br />
<br />
The cafe segment was also great as well. The coffee connoisseur went into one when he didn&#039;t want Kaguya&#039;s services and Hayasaka didn&#039;t waste time in roasting Kaguya&#039;s rubbish coffee making skills. Thankfully, Kaguya struck back by using her expertise on tea making and make the connoisseur guy and his buddy praise it to high heavens. It made for a good laugh, but then the appearance of daddy Shirogane made me go into hysterics! XD<br />
<br />
While that was happening, Ishigami was having trouble asking Tsubame to hang out with him. He needn&#039;t have worried, as Maki arrived to help him. Even though she self-inflicts pain on herself when trying to encourage Ishigami, the adorable underrated gem herself was able to succeed in getting Ishigami to take that first step with Tsubame. It did involve a bit of extra help from Nagisa and her boyfriend, but Maki definitely makes for an excellent wingwomen here, that&#039;s for sure! ^_^<br />
<br />

By the way, I recommend you to read it from beginning, because there are many unadapted chapters there (for example ch 2-4).

"So that&#039;s how Shirogane became interested in being on the council, curious. Kaguya was able to prove that she could serve a good coffee, although there was a certain detail that San noticed xD. And well, Ishigami made it, he was able to invite Tsubame.<br />

"I forgot to previously mention I love Shirogane&#039;s dad, thanks to this episode my love was strengthened.<br />
<br />
Started off a little slow this episode, we learned some history, how long Shirogane has been falling for Shinomiya and his reasons for being president too. Old president was a shitter wasn&#039;t he? This part was pretty alright, nothing groundbreaking. The tea part with the Ramen kings was alright too, right until he drank the tea.<br />
<br />
Then it became great again, yelling about how the tea was made with love for a certain someone all while Shirogane was there. Shirogane saying the tea was great, that was sweet. Then papa Shirogane was fucking hilarious.<br />
<br />
Maki really is a great character, I didn&#039;t initially appreciate how funny she is. Everyone bounces off of her so well and she is so funny herself. Poor girl, those two being in front of her makes me laugh even harder and really feel for her. Her reactions truly are fantastic.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad Shirogane managed to ask Tsubame, honestly I thought it was like a dream sequence or something with just how well it went but nope he never snapped back to reality cause it already was.  The haunted house looks like it will be hilarious. Maki and Shinomiya haven&#039;t gotten to interact enough and they will be doing so in the confines of a haunted house, it should be great. <br />

Don&#039;t think I didn&#039;t spot that Fate Go summoning reference at 8:18. That layout and design is perfectly engraved into my brain to the point where I see it in my dreams. I also just did a 2hr coping and seething summoning session for Castoria&#039;s release on NA so that screen is perfectly lasered into my eyeballs. Spoilers though on the result[spoiler] I fucking got her LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO[/spoiler]<br />
<br />
Cosplay caf&eacute; wasn&#039;t something I was expecting but it was good. Kaguya acting as a poster girl unsurprisingly rounded up a lot of attention. Kaguya standing her ground still when it comes to first class manners and perfection, even against Hayasaka but at the cost of time with Shirogane. Ah also the classic, you would&#039;ve thought it was someone else for once, but it was him [s][i][b]Di[/b][/i][/s] Father Shirogane. Also that scream at 16:00 was probably the most inhuman noise i think i have every heard Aoi Koga  create, its what i imagine a small, magical flying creature getting hit by a 4x4 going 90mph on the motor way would sound like.<br />
<br />
Some really nice backstory given to pre-student head council Shirogane which just made me think how we haven&#039;t really gotten a lot of detail about the main cast&#039;s first years before joining the student council. Old student council head really given me Ougi Oshino vibes from the quite inconspicuous nature they gave, but regardless Shirogane&#039;s episode of &quot;how I met your mother&quot; sure was a good one.<br />
<br />
Honestly didn&#039;t think I could relate or sympathies with a character as quickly as with Maki. Being a third wheel is a curse i do not wish on any soul especially when you also want to try helping others with relationship advice because they think you know a lot since you spend time accompanying two lovers before it goes full circle and you remember how cripplingly lonely you are at every waking moment.

"WOOOOOAH THIS EPISODE WAS JAM PACKED!!! It felt like a half an hour.<br />
<br />
Part 1, Miyuki and Kaguya&#039;s backstory, and the previous President, SUPER interesting lore.<br />
<br />
Part 2, the maid cafe. I honestly found the coffee reviewer to be SUPER entertaining. I mean, his character design is hilarious. But I just found it so hilariously contrived, with such well-done dialogue. I actually laughed a few times.<br />
<br />
Part 3, more best girl Ishigami scenes. I&#039;m also kind of growing fond of the &quot;mood swing&quot; character, and found her offer of hanging out with Ishigami if he got rejected to be interesting. It&#039;s always nice seeing good things happen to Ishigami. Although for a second I was kinda hoping his invitation to his crush would somehow backfire and he&#039;d end up pairing with someone whom he has more in common with. Idk how the manga plays out but I personally don&#039;t ship him with Iino hehe. Whatever the case, I reiterate, it&#039;s good seeing Ishigami genuinely happy. So this scene was a W. (And I found the dialogue between Ishigami and the three other side characters to be pretty interesting, too.)<br />
<br />
This. Episode. Was. Jam. Packed.<br />
<br />
I mean, all three scenes were so entertaining. The first was lore-heavy, the second made me audibly chuckle, and the third was Ishigami-centric. It&#039;s crazy how invested I am in this slice-of-life.

"The scene with the middle-aged men and the coffee and tea was not just intensely amusing, but intensely heartwarming when the dude gets carried away and suggests something sweet and probably true about Kaguya: that her excellence at making tea is a labor of love for Miyuki. How amazing, to love or be loved via the refinement of one&#039;s craft. Also, tangentially, I must confess I resonated with that middle-aged man - I feel like I am at risk of turning into him one day if I continue down the path of coffee geekdom that I am currently on lol.<br />

I&#039;m also super happy for Yuu! I felt like I was right there with him on that emotional rollercoaster of asking out your high school crush. This show is awesome in general, beautifully executed.

"Shirogane&#039;s lil&#039; younger sister Kei has the spotlight again to prep her stubborn, no-frills famous brother in the fashion department, tho I&#039;d say that hos fashion sense is just as weird as it looks that&#039;s done by no one. Even Shirogane&#039;s dad is also following the trend, but also &quot;like father, like son&quot; when it comes to saving and scrimping for things they need than want. [b]But deep down, we all love Kei for her familial kinship and sacrificial thought to the family.[/b]<br />
<br />
The culture festival prep is almost done, save for the usual romance rumors that Tsubame really gave Kaguya a run for her money to achieve the relationship she&#039;s always wanted with Shirogane, and LOTS of paperwork to be filed for the 2-day festival. But hot damn, that Kaguya finally started to be real with her feelings towards Shirogane, but it&#039;s a game of pride and relief.<br />
<br />
This game of losing pride and gaining relief, it&#039;s the confession game that whoever raises the question first, loses. And Kaguya JUST THREW that principle out of the window, that she might earn the courage to confess without feeling embarrassed. It&#039;s really news that Osaragi got into a relationship with the Squad Leader before the culture festival ever stated, but damn she really put a lot of thought into it based on her own terms. And that means, Ishigami FINALLY has the chance to make a move on Tsubame, but this is a one-time chance befoire graduation.<br />

"Everyone is gearing up for the school festival. Setting their minds to what needs be done at the festival. Confessions that they all need to make regardless of the implications or consequences.

Its cliche to say this but things won&#039;t be the same afterwards. As we hear in this episode, Kaguya and Shirogane are both finally willing to confess at the festival. If Kaguya doesn&#039;t first then Shirogane will. Shirogane knows his time here is limited since he&#039;s going to study in America so the festival is his best shot. No matter what, its gotta be done now so they can have time together before he leaves. Kaguya even confessing to Hayasaka about her feelings for Shirogane. Something she&#039;s never outright said before, a big step for Kaguya. Resolving herself to finally come clean to Shirogane even if he might reject her, which we know he wouldn&#039;t but she&#039;s still got that pessimistic doubt.

"Miyuki&#039;s fashion sense was so patchy that even his dad&#039;s fashion sense was much better. XD<br />

I can&#039;t blame Kei for getting pissed off about it. While her reasoning about what fashion works best was a bit unreliable and can be hugely subjective depending on the current trends or style of where you live, she did the right thing in getting him some new clothes and what she chose for him when he visted her school&#039;s festival was very nice. Her smile at the end of that segment was very cute, so her effort did pay off in the end. =)<br />
<br />
After that, we finally got to the juicy part of the episode where Kaguya finally admits to Hayasaka that she does like Miyuki. Despite that, her pride was still at odds with her feelings whether to confess first or hold out for Miyuki to do the same, if he does. She did feel at ease when hearing about Ishigami&#039;s own struggles of wanting to confess to Tsubame and Kaguya did a great job in cheering him up and having him gain the confidence needed to take the first step towards asking Tsubame out. I hope it works out for him.<br />

<br />
Kei is such an imouto with how she reacts to her brother&#039;s outfits. I can relate since the dynamic is so similar with what I have in real life, but I&#039;ll be honest Kei can be somewhat overreacting with her mood, Shirogane&#039;s 8th grader suit is so perfect. And I do find Miyuki&#039;s frugal reason to be touching, he works a lot just to make Kei fashionable, and to attain that is him sacrificing a lot of his wealth to her. So Kei buying him something decent is a reasonable payback.<br />
<br />
Now Osaragi and Cheering Leader being together, when I first read the manga I was shocked, and even now I am. But hey it gives Ishigami a very wide door to confess to Tsubame, and the way he react is amazing. Will Kaguya have the same energy once he approaches Miyuki? Let&#039;s bet to see that!<br />
<br />
Also honorable mentions to the cuts/frames they shown this episode. Maybe they&#039;re saving up the animation for later episodes, but it&#039;s funny to see some cuts from the actual manga, to the colored foreground, and some inspirations from Monogotari which is evident.

The culture festival prep is almost complete, Which as we know means were approaching the moment were Shirogane said he&#039;d confess to Kaguya if she hasn&#039;t confest to him beforehand as he&#039;ll be studying abroad next year. Not to mention Kaguya has finally started to be more honest with her feelings towards Shirogane, but it&#039;s a game of pride. In the end Love Is War. Who will come out triumphant?...<br />
<br />
This game of losing pride and gaining relief, it&#039;s the confession game that whoever raises the question first, loses. And Kaguya just threw that principle out of the window, that she might earn the courage to confess without feeling embarrassed. It&#039;s really news that Osaragi got into a relationship with the Squad Leader before the culture festival ever stated, but damn she really put a lot of thought into it based on her own terms. And that means, Ishigami finally has the chance to make a move on Tsubame, but this is a one-time chance before graduation...<br />

But man Ishigami really was on the ball during the meeting. The format in which Ino&#039;s meeting with the adults sure was unique. Thats quite the list of things that Kaguya is great at. But given its their final festival its a given that the seniors would want to do their best while having the most fun. That ball that Miyuki created sure was elaborate. In the end despite her attempts to resist Chika can&#039;t resist lending Miyuki a hand it seems. Well now i guess we know his greatest weaknesses are balloons. <br />

"The culture festival is fast approaching. Its been name dropped a few times earlier this season but now we&#039;re making some headway as preparations ramp up. This arc is one of the best in this whole series. Shirogane mentioned something before that he might need to do and it changes everything in the story. Its a whole paradigm shift. But anyways back in the present the students are getting their ducks in a row so they can have the best festival possible. Ishigami and Iino joining the planning committee, the former so he can be close to Tsubame his crush with the hilarious one up manship, and the latter I suppose just to keep things in line as a member of the disciplinary committee. As well as Iino apparent love for campfires. Going to great lengths so the festival can have one, completely contradicting her speech during the council election last season. But wanting that idealic campfire so much she petitions the neighborhood Association and asks all the proximity residents for their permission. A lot of tedious work but it shows the impressive will Iino possesses. <br />
<br />
The interviewers going around asking people about the festival were making me laugh so much. They sort of seem like audience surrogates since they were crushing on Kaguya and Shirogane so much. Everyone they went to had something hilarious to say which make me crack up multiple times. On top of their own commentary about each club and person they spoke to. The end line about Shirogane might&#039;ve sounded like another joke but its more true than first realized. Shirogane himself not having much luck with balloon art. Chika almost helping him like usual but it wouldn&#039;t have made much difference as we saw at the end. It did lead to a nice moment with Shirogane and Kaguya alone together. Aside from the ballot torture Kaguya endured she said some heartfelt things to Shirogane which were nice. The culture festival draws near and everyone is trying their best to make it as special and unforgettable as possible.

"The culture festival is here..at least the prep for it is ongoing. With Tsubame as overall lead planner, Ishigami is just going with the flow because you know, you know. Iino hates what she hears, but there&#039;s no choice that she can actually butt in, much less the boys looking to impress Tsubame with Ishigami having a low-brow against them. Certainly no less of drama brought from Iino that she has learned her lesson from.<br />
<br />
With approval, the prep is well underway with the entire Shuchiin Academy on fire for making the 2-day festival worth it, but the Archery Club sure has Kaguya worshippers ready to praise her for all she is. The interview done with certain key people, well if it ever was done, but it&#039;s the giant dragon with a ball prank that&#039;ll be the centerpiece of the festival, looking forward to it.<br />

The scene setting up for Shirogane and Shinomiya to meet was pretty funny though, her trying her hardest not to give into maternal instincts.<br />

"The preparation for the festival is underway, but not without some tough obstacles. Miko definitely had a bit of a rough time in the cultural festival committee at first when her ideas or objections were questioned at first, which left her in limbo, but after some encouraging words from Ishigami, Miko revitalised herself and got herself back in top form and went out of her way so that the school could have a bonfire after all. Not just that, but she also got the rather glum Onodera to have fun and smile with her, which was nice. =)<br />
<br />
Erika and Karen made for an entertaining interviewing duo, especially when they went all fangirl mode for Kaguya while she was practicing her archery skills. I do hope we see them again, as these two girls were great fun.<br />
<br />
No matter how hard she tries to resist, Chika can&#039;t help but be in her motherly mode when it comes to helping out Miyuki whenever he is struggling. She&#039;s quick to criticise him, but she helps him when he needs it the most. Her defense of him when Kashiwagi was cute, especially with how she roasted Kashigawi with her back comment, too.

"Bit of a calmer episode with the build up of the festival.

Iino witnessing Ishigami&#039;s true colors when in the Culture Festival Committee was funny. Leave it to Ishigami to fend of three people at once when it comes to facts and statistics, God he&#039;s such a badass.<br />
<br />
I guess another plus of the festival for the viewer is seeing all the various other clubs and the people in, cus wow I&#039;m really surprised about how many characters we&#039;ve yet to see until now. The Mass Media club looks like a clown fest that i absolutely would want to see more of even as a side gimmick. Ryuju from the Astronomy club seems like an interesting character with her father being in the yakuza and her personality catches my attention a lot. The Board club game&#039;s other members besides from Fujiwara seem like absolute wild cards i would love to see more of.<br />
<br />
Shirogane getting an important life lesson about overcoming obstacles by himself, with Fujiwara desperately holding herself back, almost comes ends well before Fujiwara herself jinxes it. <br />

<br />
Shirogane and Kaguya sure had some deep feelings for each other here, in the beginning, the chances of them getting helped by their student council members are low because they do think outside of the box.<br />

Chika is sure a prodigy at every instrument she was able to acquire knowledge with what she values most. Also, Shirogane is a womanizer confirmed because he&rsquo;s confessing to someone else instead of Kaguya! Iino and Chika are adorable blobs in this episode because they&rsquo;re against Shirogane&rsquo;s way of an ikemen approach and the girls certainly do have the ideals.

Hayasaka being a mama&#039;s daughter like that was surprising, lol. Shirogane&#039;s father is a real piece of work too, but got to give it for that entrance though with the stellar buildup.

The deadline however did serve well to make the two realize that time waits for no one. But man the abrupt tag team of Ishigami, Chika and Ino really proved effective. The results that Miyuki tried to attain sure were harsher than he thought they would be. But it is correct that its hard for humans to look at themselves objectively.

Shirogane&#039;s dad also appeared out of nowhere to fill in as Kaguya&#039;s dad, but also keeping tabs on Kaguya and Shirogane&#039;s relationship. It seems that Shirogane has made a decision to go to Stanford University to study abroad so time is running out for both of them to confess until the cultural festival. Kaguya  and Shirogane desperately tried to ask each other out, but neither of them couldn&#039;t come out and say it. Chika, Ishigami, and Iino entering the room didn&#039;t help either.

"The amount of time remaining is dwindling. Shirogane is heading off to America for college so he only has about a year left till him and Kaguya won&#039;t be together anymore. Things have certainly progressed between Shirogane and Kaguya from when the show first started but they still haven&#039;t reached that coveted dating phase. With these parent teacher conferences going on Shirogane knows now the timetable is shrinking for them to be a couple before he heads off. Adding some tension since now we the audience know too, Shirogane has to step his game up. Can&#039;t have any regrets like his dad said. Him trying to ask Kaguya out all sly to that other school&#039;s culture festival was hilarious. They&#039;re both trying to play it so casual that neither fully picks up on what the other is meaning through their words till its too late. That classic aww dammit if only they&#039;d realized sooner, and it&#039;s so funny. Shirogane not feeling super confident in himself leading to him asking the female members of the student council what they think of him. Chika and Iino were brutal. Totally chopping down whay Shirogane thought of himself. But its true that looking at ourselves objectively is tough.

And TOEFL, for those who don&#039;t know, is a necessary exam that you need to take for proving you proficiency in English, especially if you are trying to apply for a higher education in United States.

Shirogane and Kaguya sure had some deep feelings for each other here, in the beginning, the chances of them getting helped by their student council members are low because they do think outside of the box.<br />

Chika is sure a prodigy at every instrument she was able to acquire knowledge with what she values most.

The rest of the episode was still comedy gold, though. Miyuki trying to ask Kaguya out to see another school&#039;s culture festival was great, with Miyuki going with Ishigami instead. After that, it was Miyuki trying to look at himself more objectively led to him making a confessional misunderstanding with Miko (Her blushing face was so damn adorable!!) before she and Chika brutally roasted him. Thankfully, Kaguya was his savior in saying that he is fine the way he is, which was really sweet.<br />
<br />

And TOEFL, for those who don&#039;t know, is a necessary exam that you need to take for proving you proficiency in English, especially if you are trying to apply for a higher education in United States.

Akasaka Aka had been weaving the web and spinning the gears to put what is to come in motion for a long time unbeknown to much of the audience. And these small details are one of the things that makes me love this franchise so much.<br />

Absolutely love Shirogane dad&#039;s personality, he can spit out the wildest things about youth like a dad while keeping such a serious and straight face. Also that Koyasu Takehito ASMR we got I literally felt down to my bones. Nao-san and Father Shirogane collectively deciding to be Shinomiya&#039;s step in parents made me laugh more then it should of, its just how they both agreed to it so quickly and how although Father Shirogane time with Shinomiya has been quite short he&#039;s already volunteering to be a step in parent for her,<br />

Haha parent confrontation or &quot;parents evening&quot; as we call it here what fun times. My last parents evening i had my music teacher absolutely obliterate me right in front of my parents while keeping permanent eye contact with me as I just sat and watched. Fun memories.<br />

Second half was wild, Shirogane studying oversees seems like a decent way to push the plot forward, but the hardest part of confessing begins. Poor Shirogane building up all his courage just so Shinomiya overcomplicates the question and lets the poor man down, then after we see a r/roastme thread starring Shirogane. Suprisingly we see Iino hurt herself emotionally in the process as well as Fujiwara indirectly coming to the conclusion Shirogane is her type of man, before Shinomiya fixes Shirogane&#039;s emotional state, before it goes tumbling down again and Shirogane spends his culture festival with Ishigami. <br />

"Les go they&rsquo;re adapting the rap battle Part 1! Another series of Mama Chika is about to save the day for the one and only Shirogane! One thing I&#039;ve learned about rap is that it&#039;s only for intellectuals and oh god, even Chika is dead after hearing him doing the rap. The rap scene is pretty good, Chika is too cute and it was hilarious that Shirogane told Chika to teach him how to rap while Chika just nailed it I&rsquo;m weak, she really said Motherf***kerrrrrrr xD. <br />
<br />
PART 2 IS EVEN AMAZING, EVERYONE&rsquo;S PART WAS SO GOOD, from Shirogane and Chika&rsquo;s teamwork, not gonna lie the display felt like some rap music video in 2009. Kaguya&rsquo;s part is lil exaggerated at first but then she&rsquo;s able to get on the beat, also her singing in the 2nd half gave such an eerie vibe lmao and Hayasaka&rsquo;s part is also interesting, ad then again the direction in PART 2 of the rap battle is amazing to display something unusual but was able to execute it in an interesting aesthetic, not gonna lie they pretty much nail this scene. <br />
<br />
Heh, Shirogane and Ishigami saw Maki crying on the floor. Maki&rsquo;s presence gave me a lil worry about her third-wheeling Nagisa and Tsubasa :/ but it&rsquo;s just a side thing in the overall series. <br />

"A crazy looking unique ending song! Glad that this show has kept up that trend of having really unique ways to spice up the plain standard of having the same ending song each episode. Makes sense with the episode content too, rapping being a central part of the chapters adapted in majority of the episode. Shirogane going to Chika for advice on rap since she&#039;s helped him out so much before with his troubles. Which makes it even more hilarious cause Chika knows next to nothing about rap and hip-hop music! Going through all that trouble just for Shirogane to turn around and say ok now teach me even though I just taught you. Shirogane with the worst uno reverse card ever. <br />
<br />
His rapping needed some serious work, can&#039;t keep pitch and rhythm in check at the same time. Chika making the perfect analogy of it being like two endgame bosses combining into something even stronger since she helped him out with pitch and rhythm individually in the previous seasons. All this just so Shirogane can convey his feelings to Hayasaka after the disastrous karaoke he performed a few episodes ago. But the message he wants to get across to her is an important one. That you don&#039;t have to put on an act for people to like you. Hayasaka thinking that&#039;s the only way to receive love, by faking and not showing your true self. A very sad way to think of things which is why I&#039;m so glad MC Miyuki shattered that idea in her mind! Showing off his new badass rapping Shirogane tore it up! Lit that Mic on fire!! Loved all the cool animation bits they did with the circular Park shape being like a record. Shirogane and Chika walking around and around Hayasaka. Whom herself finally opened up after Kaguya had to butt in. Its a lot for Hayasaka to bear being the one who has to look after someone else and sacrifice her adolescence. Really amazing part in glad they did it so well. <br />
<br />
Last part of the episode was more akin to the normal antics. Maki coming back to the student council room for advice after she joined the club that Kashiwagi and her boyfriend are apart of so how they&#039;re relationship is right in her face. Its difficult expressing your love for someone boldly, Ishigami and Shirogane know all about that.

"The Maki segment in the final third stuck out like a sore thumb and wasn&#039;t that great, but the rest of the episode in the Rap arc was good, and the ending was great here, looked fantastic in particular and really the whole rap portion was well-directed in this episode (including the ending too with how that was animated so well). It was nice seeing a switchup with the Miyuki-Chika segments with not only having Miyuki train Chika to train him, but then having the actual rap segments involve Hayasaka and Kaguya like that to help Hayasaka out was cool too.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t close to being as fun as the Kongming rap episode which was just awesome from start to finish, especially with the back and forth throughout the majority of the episode and with the flows, but this one was a decent enough counterpart to it. It was a good episode overall with a final third that belonged in a different episode from this to be honest, to prevent it from being close to a great one. Although to be honest, while the rap segments were nice here, they weren&#039;t again offering the best that the series has offered up to this point.

Damm Hayasaka seeing the prez rap will be akin to a nightmare. Its funny that his main reason for wanting to improve it was because of that incident. But man that rapping really is something. Hmm to think that Hayasaka would end up telling the prez about her true role. But it really served to make their foray to the park that much more interesting. The switch to Hayasaka&#039;s POV during the rap was a nice move. Kaguya&#039;s response though was surprisingly fun. But it was Hayasaka&#039;s display of her true feelings that she told through her song that was the most entertaining. Feels like Maki&#039;s being affected more and more with Nagisa&#039;s relationship. Still the meeting proved to be a rare one where three people of similar predicaments were able meet. Have to say its amusing just how much Kaguya overreacts when the prez gets another girl friend. The new ending theme sure was a unique one with Chika and Miyuki&#039;s rapping. ,damm hayasaka seeing prez rap akin nightmare funny main reason wanting improve incident man rapping really something hmm think hayasaka would end telling prez true role really served make foray park much interesting switch hayasaka 039 pov rap nice move kaguya 039 response though surprisingly fun hayasaka 039 display true feelings told song entertaining feels like maki 039 affected nagisa 039 relationship still meeting proved rare one three people similar predicaments able meet say amusing much kaguya overreacts prez gets another girl friend new ending theme sure unique one chika miyuki 039 rapping

<br />
First half with the usual struggles of Shirogane and Fujiwara was amusing to watch. In particular, I couldn&#039;t help but snort when Shirogane requested to be taught right after explaining the ways of rapping first, how does that even work logically xD? <br />
<br />
Creative representation for a lot of the rap sequences in the climax of the episode, you&#039;d have to think they might&#039;ve used up everything in the think tank but they just never fail to give. <br />

Their stance on honesty is probably solidified in Maki&#039;s chapter when the guys so confidently profess that you should throw away pride sooner than later and just confess now.

It was nice seeing a switchup with the Miyuki-Chika segments with not only having Miyuki train Chika to train him, but then having the actual rap segments involve Hayasaka and Kaguya like that to help Hayasaka out was cool too.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t close to being as fun as the Kongming rap episode which was just awesome from start to finish, especially with the back and forth throughout the majority of the episode and with the flows, but this one was a decent enough counterpart to it. It was a good episode overall with a final third that belonged in a different episode from this to be honest, to prevent it from being close to a great one. Although to be honest, while the rap segments were nice here, they weren&#039;t again offering the best that the series has offered up to this point.

Still, I&#039;m glad if Herthaka or Hayasaca really and finally understood her own feelings through their rapping earlier. Chika is really cute rapping though, I missed her rap but we didn&#039;t get much rap out of Kaguya... (ÔΩ°Ôæâ&omega;ÔººÔΩ°)<br />

P.S. The new ED is kinda bad as I didn&#039;t get any clue what they were trying to &quot;convey&quot; (unless there&#039;s an English sub soon) but watching the 4 of them on stage in 3D CGI isn&#039;t as great as I hoped they could be. It was average for me.<br />

"Even after having it spoiled for me by a manga reader, that was definitely one of the best rap bits I&rsquo;ve seen in an anime lol, it was great to see Shirogane&rsquo;s evolution and I love how it ended up being about Hayasaka near the end, the amount of her in this season has been very pleasing as a believer of Hayasaka supremacy lol. But man the entire thing was great, I also liked what I think was a Queen &ldquo;Bohemian Rhapsody&rdquo; reference by Kaguya, and of course I loved the curse words thrown in.<br />

And not only that but Maki had a great part in this episode, I&rsquo;m really enjoying her relationship with Shirogane and Ishigami and that last part where she said they were her friends was really wholesome, with a perfect Kaguya reaction to go with it.

"This was my favorite episode of the series so far, I loved Chika&#039;s rapping (Chika swearing arc?), and even Shirogane&#039;s was good as well. Kaguya&#039;s rapping, even though it was unintentional, was pretty good as well. I honestly liked everyone&#039;s rapping, everyone did a pretty good job, and the VAs are really good, and they most likely were having fun with this episode (along with others, but mostly this episode.<br />
<br />
Ngl, when I saw Maki, I got kinda nervous. I like Nagisa and Tsubane as a couple so I don&#039;t really want her to date Tsubane (though he would most likely reject her, seeing as how bad the poor girl is at love.) but I do want her to date somebody. She isn&#039;t my favori5e character (I mostly dislike her for trying to date Tsubane, since I&#039;m pretty sure he has a healthy realtionship, and plus he&#039;s already dating someone) but I do feel like she deserves to have a boyfriend. It&#039;s honestly kinda sad that someone can be so bad at love.<br />
<br />

"It somehow gets even better with every episode, amazing.",somehow gets even better every episode amazing
what did I just watch ?,watch
"The rap was funny AF, one of the best episode so far",rap funny af one best episode far
"To think in a space of barely a week, we got rapping segments from Aharen-San, Ya Boy Konming! and now Kaguya-Sama. Seriously, what are the odds of that happening? XD<br />
<br />
The whole rapping segment was excellent. Chika had to endure more pain from hearing Miyuki&#039;s &quot;rapping&quot; at first, which gave us a funny volume warning which almost killed her and she learnt rapping from him so that she can teach it to him so that he can learn from it better. Also, bonus points for Chika shouting &quot;MotherfXXXer!!&quot; as well. =P<br />
<br />
The result? A great rapping song with Miyuki, Chika, Hayasaka and even Kaguya, who got involved as well. I won&#039;t blame anyone who would compare this rap battle to Kongming&#039;s battle and think which one is better. For me, both were simply amazing in their own right, so I&#039;ll leave it at that. =)<br />
<br />
This episode had time to focus more on Maki, who was still having a hard time dealing with Nagisa and her boyfriend, Tubasa. It led to a funny conversation between her, Miyuki and Ishigami and they could all relate to one another. Kaguya chose that time to arrive once again and panicked as Miyuki now has another female friend in the form of Maki. Seriously though, the way Maki smiled while in-between Miyuki and Ishigami and calling those two friends of hers was adorable.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the special ED animation was awesome, right up there with the Chika dance from season one. A great song and animation quality makes for something spectacular, that&#039;s for sure. ^_^",think space barely week got rapping segments aharen san ya boy konming! kaguya sama seriously odds happening xd whole rapping segment excellent chika endure pain hearing miyuki 039 quot rapping quot first gave us funny volume warning almost killed learnt rapping teach learn better also bonus points chika shouting quot motherfxxxer!! quot well p result great rapping song miyuki chika hayasaka even kaguya got involved well 039 blame anyone would compare rap battle kongming 039 battle think one better simply amazing right 039 leave episode time focus maki still hard time dealing nagisa boyfriend tubasa led funny conversation miyuki ishigami could relate one another kaguya chose time arrive panicked miyuki another female friend form maki seriously though way maki smiled miyuki ishigami calling two friends adorable lastly special ed animation awesome right chika dance season one great song animation quality makes something spectacular 039 sure _

Easily the funniest and best episode of kaguya sama s3 without a doubt.<br />
And the ED is great too I heard it is animated soley by a 18 year old boy and it is even better than Chika dance maybe this ED is also for 1 episode only<br />

"That ending was straight up fire, came here instantly after watching the ed. This episode was very enjoyable and i can see people switching to the manga after this. I do agree that Maki should get a boyfriend but I see this as another obstacle between Kaguya and Miyuki. I think Maki will tease Miyuki and Ishigami from now on and Kaguya and Tsubame will catch on, its just a theory though.<br />

The whole rap thing was a lot of fun, and a unique way to finally get Fujiwara to express her own feelings for a change. Very refreshing.<br />

Then the rap battle, my fucking sides. Shirogane with his genuine heartfelt lyrics and Chika saying boys fucking is pretty cool. The part about Hayasaka going off on Kaguya was great and the visuals throughout were wonderful as well. <br />

The Maki part was great this time. She had some great expressions and the boys putting themselves in her shoes was great. They are all birds of a feather at different stages. Them being all friends and understanding one another was sweet. I enjoyed their time together a lot.<br />

"I didn&#039;t liked the rap chapter when I first read it, and judging on some scenes in S1 and S2 where we do get some rhyming and spitting, it is kinda killing me when listening to them voicing it out. So now that we do get the rap scenes, I&#039;ll say that....it&#039;s still kinda eh. Though Shirogane busting rhymes in (with those cool animation) to Hayasaka is a banger, Kaguya and Hayasaka&#039;s scheme doesn&#039;t suit my ears. But I gotta highlight those very cool animation styles that they utilize and visualize, like the fish-eye zoom on Hayasaka&#039;s (beautiful) face and the Queen reference on Kaguya.

<br />
This episode is completely bonkers!!! Such an enjoyable episode! Definitely the most music-heavy one so far and it&#039;s so nice to listen to.<br />
<br />
There is an unbelievable amount of effort to make all this possible, from the sound composition required to create the musical tracks and beats in the first place, to the VAs reciting and singing out the raps to this degree. Don&#039;t even get me started on how nostalgic it was to see some traditional music video filming technique, the fish lens up-close shot of Hayasaka reminds me of the early 2000s music video a lot! Miyuki&#039;s and Chika&#039;s raps slap [b]HARD[/b]. Where Miyuki wanted to convince Hayasaka to reveal her true self and not hide behind a mask, Chika is out here just trying to figure out whether she should support a gay relationship between Miyuki and Hayasaka-Kun (persona) LMAO!<br />
<br />
To top it all off, the ED is different with a hip-hop special ending, and a vastly different art style and visuals. What the hell, this 3rd season is spitting out straight-up bangers side to side! They really don&#039;t need to go this far for the season to be enjoyable, but these aspects just made this season just that much more enjoyable to watch!<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it&#039;s nice to see Maki, Ishigami and Miyuki getting along together as they relate to one another&#039;s experiences regarding something they have encountered before. That was really wholesome to see them three just chatting it out, such a warm fuzzy feeling.<br />

"Wow, I can totally understand why this episode forum has the most comments.<br />
<br />
Was this adapted from the manga? (Actually idek if there is one, I&#039;ve just come to assume that most anime are adaptations of manga.) If so, doesn&#039;t that mean they had to create all the musical elements from scratch?<br />
<br />
I really appreciate this episode for what it is. Instead of a usual plot, they had to get really creative and write/compose/choreograph a bunch of &quot;rap/hip-hop&quot; sequences. And I admire this show&#039;s efforts in wanting to try something new. <br />
<br />
I liked the initial Chika rap at around 6:30. And the balls they had to have her rhyme suck with f***. And the fact that Chika says that multiple times throughout the episode. And the fact that the President felt true gratitude after it despite getting roasted. <br />
<br />
But the true magnificence was around 10:45, with Miyuki&#039;s main rapping sequence. It was all just so creative and well-done. Not something any of us would have expected from this show. I liked the VHS effect, that 90s musical video fisheye effect, and the parkour too. <br />
It&#039;s really interesting seeing Japan&#039;s idea of American rapping. And I think their spoof of it is pretty accurate, even if in a slightly ironic way. Although, I think those involved with [i]Kaguya[/i] [i]were[/i] expressing genuine praise toward rap music, and tried to paint it in an endearing light. Which is kind of cute, and charming. But who&#039;d have expected this show to have a rap-themed episode... what a timely classic.<br />
And ngl, I think the flow of the vocals were well-performed too. This was just an all-around cool episode, and definitely one of the best for all the dedication that went into it. Miyuki might be the least popular character of the initial four MCs, but he&#039;s still a very, very good character. I like that aside from achieving good grades and having some other skills, he also has many many flaws. And it&#039;s nice seeing him tackle them one-by-one. <br />
<br />
The other segments were interesting too. I really do enjoy music all-around, so I also found Kaguya&#039;s vocal harmonies to be very appealing to listen to. <br />
<br />
I feel like this is one of those episodes that would especially warrant a rewatch. I can see people coming back to this one for all the musical sequences.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I&#039;m repeating myself, but this is an incredible episode. You can tell they&#039;re really trying to up the ante and distinguish themselves from other slice-of-lifes. I&#039;ve seen similar stuff in a few anime, but this is still really, really refreshing and unique. 10/10 episode, and 10/10 show, for sure. It truly has earned itself that objective rating. All the way to the end of the episode, I feel like so much happened. From the usual gags, having to compose unique music and write raps for the characters, to the choreography of everything, the effects, and even the plot involving the blonde girl&#039;s complex identity ... I feel as though I just finished three episodes in one, surely this episode took a while for the people involved to produce. I hope they all got the compensation they deserve, because you can tell this episode wasn&#039;t rushed or made as a cash grab, but they actually wanted to create something funny, entertaining, and [i]ORIGINAL[/i].

"Gah. I&#039;ve returned to this forum to voice my ONE, one retrospective complaint for this episode... and the season overall, as of Episode 9...<br />
<br />
Is that Hayasaka revealing her true identity to Miyuki was WAY too rushed, not well done, anti-climactic, and ABRUPT. Given the complex history these two characters share, it felt kind of strange to just - out of nowhere - have Hayasaka explain her connection to Kaguya, JUST like that, out of nowhere. (At 8:15, I mean.) Idk why but this just really bothers me. After all the plots that revolved around these two - and Hayasaka having to hide her connection to Kaguya ..... just like that, Hayasaka decides to break the guise. And not even chronologically! It&#039;s done via some random flashback!!! Ugh.<br />
<br />
However, I appreciate how later in the episode, it is revealed that Hayasaka still longs to have a somewhat normal high school life, and is genuinely happy to be friends with Miyuki.

Despite not reaching the top ranks rising by 20 ranks from his previous position is still an impressive achievement. Kaguya losing her composure was hillarious.

"Kaguya and Ishigami have one of the more interesting dynamics in this show. Very strong big sister and little brother energy. She&#039;s always trying to get him to be better at whichever his focus is, usually studying since Ishigami is terrible at studying. Most of this episode dedicated to them working together trying to get Ishigami better grades so he can impress his crush Tsubame, whom herself hinted at a major upcoming event. Which is funny since that whole idea came from Kaguya since she likes those qualities in Shirogane so they must be attractive in everyone right. It hurt seeing Ishigami only jump up those small amount of spots for his grade, he actually tried this time and didn&#039;t get much closer. Everyone lying about their motives was funny at the beginning. Shirogane and Kaguya each getting distracted in opposite ways, Chika lying about needing the money, Iino staving off her own classmates for the top grade, but it turned sad at the end when Ishigami lied about being bitter towards his low improvement. Great character writing for Ishigami in this episode. Capping it off with Kaguya and Chika sleepover. Hayasaka having yet another disguise made me laugh so much.

Of course, Kaguya can&#039;t help but to share her happiness about Shirogane, and attempts to help Ishigami regain his confidence.<br />
<br />
Even when it comes to exams, romance always takes precedence, and both Kaguya and Shirogane feel the pressure. Iino wants to be like Shirogane to be No. 1, but Chika is the same goofiness as always, other than everyone being liars and Ishigami being rock-bottom, climbing up to Top 50 with Kaguya&#039;s help is just asking too much for someone whom his NEET-ness is characterization. Good on those who excelled.<br />
<br />
Exans are over, and sleepover commences for Chika while Hayasaka dons her male persona to avoid being suspected and playing with her feelings. The video call though, Chika sure can run her mouth, and that with Shirogane&#039;s sister Kei, confirms the suspicion...or misconception rather that it&#039;s Hayasaka. A drunk Kaguya makes Shirogane&#039;s situation almost worthless though, what a huge misunderstanding.<br />

This is the first episode of Season 4 that actually was great fun..I thought Kaguya S3 has lost its charm but this episode proved me wrong.Greatness has struck again üòÑüòÑ,first episode season actually great fun thought kaguya s3 lost charm episode proved wrong greatness struck
"Before this wall of text starts, I want to highlight that split second frame of Iino&#039;s [b]crazy maniacal face[/b] when she thinks of having more time to study, that frame of her face is one of the best and most hilarious of this series so far. Now with that mentioned, I want to spill more!<br />
<br />
The whole scene on how Ishigami acts when Tsubame&#039;s around, how he put on his poker face when Kaguya got a nip of it, and his drive to study better in the exam is literally every teenager who&#039;s trying to impress a crush that is out of his/her league. I can tell based from my conventional exp---<br />
<br />
But jokes aside, having your heart crushed by disappointment and failure is not an entitlement you want to have for your whole youth, so I understand Ishigami&#039;s bitter cry in the restroom. And hopefully he comes to his senses and strive for Tsubame&#039;s attention...but ngl some of his confession ideas is not creepy at all.<br />
<br />
Ah Chika visiting Kaguya&#039;s house, normal stuff since childhood and of course Male Herthaka! Seeing Kaguya drunk but sober is me these days, sleep schedule sure is lit. And that part where Kei got to see her senpais in Shirogane&#039;s vidcall and she proceeds to clean the room instantaneously is pretty much how little sisters react in a nutshell. Lastly, Chika nosebleeding to Male Herthaka and Shirogane slip is literally how I view the hardcore yaoi fans.<br />
<br />

But yeah I think this might be a favorite episode of mine lol.<br />
<br />
And now we know why the series is called Ultra Romantic from Ishigami&rsquo;s plan in this episode, I was wondering about that lol.",one laughing pretty hard especially video call part damn hilarious lol sleep drunk kaguya great love see kei shirogane fighting like siblings lol herthaka bit got chika rsquo nose bleeding really got cool see another hayasaka alter ego tho add list rsquo best girl first half focused ishigami also really good nice see tsubame ishigami feelings surprise test score part rough really liking kaguya coaching ishigami stuff yeah think might favorite episode mine lol know series called ultra romantic ishigami rsquo plan episode wondering lol

<br />
It is very good because its an emotion roller coaster at first it&rsquo;ll make you laugh then they&rsquo;ll make you really excited then make you cry and finally they&rsquo;ll make you shiver in happiness which was beautiful <br />
<br />
Ps : im a big fan of Ishigami x Tsubame",episode really really favorite episode far good emotion roller coaster first rsquo make laugh rsquo make really excited make cry finally rsquo make shiver happiness beautiful ps big fan ishigami x tsubame
The sleepover with Chika was just hilarious to see. Tsubama got introduced and Hagekawa had her time again. A pretty good episode once again.,sleepover chika hilarious see tsubama got introduced hagekawa time pretty good episode
"As of now, this is the funniest episode of season 3!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s interesting to see that Ishigami has a crush on Tsubame, the spirited girl from the cheerleader squad who influenced him really well back in season 2 and I don&#039;t blame him at all, as she&#039;s a rather charming girl with a nice personality. Kaguya made sure that he was honest with himself, but was also on hand to offer him advice on what step to take next in order to get Tsubame&#039;s interest.<br />
<br />
And that step involved the second semester exams, which had everyone on edge. Special mention to Miko here as she had a split second frame of her looking like she&#039;s gone completely psycho that made me burst out laughing! XD<br />
<br />
Sadly for Ishigami, he couldn&#039;t crack the top 50 within his year and Kaguya got the truth out of him which showcased how angry and frustrated he was with himself, before he declares that he&#039;ll crack the top 50 next time. Best of luck, Ishigami! =)<br />
<br />
Lastly, we had Chika sleeping over at Kaguya&#039;s mansion, where Hayasaka put on another disguise, with this one being a male butler and her remarks and talking placed in some juicy reactions from Chika, which I loved.<br />
<br />
However, it got better when Chika called up Miyuki late at night for a video call when Kaguya was completely tired. To make matters more awkward for Miyuki, his younger sister, Kei, showed a huge amount of interest in the call which ended up talking about Miyuki&#039;s love life, which made Kei go all crazy.<br />
<br />
To top it all off, Chika got an out of control nosebleed after hearing the &quot;reveal&quot;, which had me laughing in stitches again. Misunderstandings, when done right, can bring out the best humour and this series is no exception to that. Absolutely brilliant! ^_^",funniest episode season 3! 039 interesting see ishigami crush tsubame spirited girl cheerleader squad influenced really well back season 039 blame 039 rather charming girl nice personality kaguya made sure honest also hand offer advice step take next order get tsubame 039 interest step involved second semester exams everyone edge special mention miko split second frame looking like 039 gone completely psycho made burst laughing! xd sadly ishigami 039 crack top 50 within year kaguya got truth showcased angry frustrated declares 039 crack top 50 next time best luck ishigami! lastly chika sleeping kaguya 039 mansion hayasaka put another disguise one male butler remarks talking placed juicy reactions chika loved however got better chika called miyuki late night video call kaguya completely tired make matters awkward miyuki younger sister kei showed huge amount interest call ended talking miyuki 039 love life made kei go crazy top chika got control nosebleed hearing quot reveal quot laughing stitches misunderstandings done right bring best humour series exception absolutely brilliant! _

Best episode of the season so far! ,best episode season far!
"Safe to say Ishigami is definitely one of my favourite characters in this franchise, not just from his personality but from his character growth as well. My first impressions of him are definitely overshadowed by my current ones, his past shown combined with the amount of development we&#039;ve seen him have while in the student council has genuinely resulted in a well built character with a depressing yet unique story that is willing to change. <br />
Exams are undeniably a bitch, but after Kaguya not only gave him an earful but also a reason to try ([i]be it Kaguya&#039;s will or his goal to impress his dream girl[/i]) mans had a goal and gave it his all. Honestly even if he didn&#039;t hit the mark the message that Ishigami still wants to put in the effort for something be it because he wants to impress of girl, or simply because a good friend asked him of it is extremely valuable. <br />
Not sure if i&#039;m speaking for myself, but that final scene of denying to someone that your bitter after missing that target grade when actually your screaming inside and can&#039;t wait to go home and just cry hit very personally.<br />
<br />
Have to also say Ishigami and Kaguya duo scenes are some of my favourites from this series. There wild chemistry of being able to bounce of one another&#039;s train of thought is amazing to watch, on one hand there can be very serious topics like Ishigami&#039;s grades with Kaguya actually taking time to help him, then bits like the talk about confessing to another person and having one another calling each other out before it goes down hill to a screaming extravaganza, honestly these two are a great duo to watch<br />
<br />
Second half was wild, Hanamori Yumiri&#039;s deep voice for Hayasaka&#039;s male butler get-up had me down [b]atrocious[/b]. The misunderstanding of Shirogane and Hayasaka during the call had me rolling with Chika&#039;s reaction and i don&#039;t think i&#039;ve heard Shirogane scream as much as in those final seconds.<br />
<br />
Also props for Shirogane and Iino for 1st place again, whats that like 2 years for Shirogane?

"Ishigami&#039;s character is so full of self-sacrifices for the benefit of others, he&#039;s the man who threw his life and reputation on the line for the sake of others without any intention of being awarded anything. What is this world without selfless individuals like he is? Though he may lurk in the shadows, and though he may be the target of relentless negativity, both from himself and those who know nothing about him. Ishigami has time and time again made effort to help others in need whether it be something major or minor.<br />
<br />
Therefore... Seeing Ishigami so earnestly attempt to improve himself despite all the shackles and setbacks he has endured really damn near made me tear up, the OST used during the scene in which he&#039;s bitterly frustrated at his failure alone in the bathroom is perfect. It&#039;s the kind of pain which you can&#039;t help but be frustrated with and blame yourself. Keep going, King! You may walk the path of darkness but a chad will remain strong and brave the abyss to finally attain the light of victory at the far end of the line. Supported by Kaguya and his fellow closest friends, Yu Ishigami will prevail!<br />
<br />
Honestly, that was the highlight of this episode, when Ishigami&#039;s predicament is taken seriously, there isn&#039;t much backstory (so far in the anime) that can surpass the depth and emotion that Ishigami&#039;s contain.

"AYYYE, [i]Kaiji/Gyakky≈ç[/i] at around the 11-minute mark with Iino. Frickin hilarious. It happened for like a split second and actually terrified me for a second.<br />
<br />
But yeah, these Ishigami storylines always hit hard. At 4:45, with the hand on the chin and the &quot;make her yours&quot; -- that was such a powerful scene. Love the dynamic with Kaguya and Ishigami. And idk how they always manage to make Ishigami a hilarious yet heart-wrenching character. I hate to say it, because I love the main storyline too, but Ishigami arcs are always my favorite. Seeing him genuinely cry about failing to study hit so hard. And I admire the story for not letting him miraculously reach the Top 50 on the first try -- there&#039;s something refreshing about Ishigami &quot;failing&quot; (if going from 190-ish to 150 can be called failing). Favorite episode so far.

Kaguya and Maki have something in common that plays a role as the story progresses so this was a very tense scene for me personally.

Hoping the episodes can improve quickly though, at least to be like the second episode for the time being.

Ah yes the sense of jealousy among teens lol. Its strange to see Kaguya and Nagisa be so in sync though. Still the sudden change when karaoke was mentioned sure was funny. Compared to Nagisa Maki as a tsun seems to be more comparable to the boyfriend. Shirogane&#039;s advice from back then sure came back to haunt him thats for sure. If anything the relationship between branch and main families really is complex. The Ten yen coin game though sure was amusing. Bringing a polygraph though is a bit extreme even for Chika. ,ah yes sense jealousy among teens lol strange see kaguya nagisa sync though still sudden change karaoke mentioned sure funny compared nagisa maki tsun seems comparable boyfriend shirogane 039 advice back sure came back haunt thats sure anything relationship branch main families really complex ten yen coin game though sure amusing bringing polygraph though bit extreme even chika

"Shirogane past dating advice has come back to haunt him. His previous remarks to Kashiwagi has helped out her dating life out immensely but also added some pain. Suspecting her boyfriend of cheating just cause he was shopping with another girl. Damn that&#039;s cold, I mean its definitely not a good look for the guy regardless of circumstances but its still not cheating. Kaguya instantly jumping on Kashiwagi side was hilarious. Just locked in with that same cold look and knowing its absolutely cheating no matter what. Until the topic of karaoke came up then Momo switches to the cheating side while Kaguya tries to brush it off since Shirogane went there with Hayasaka last episode. Absolute gold how this story has developed the characters and while seeming like a standard gag plot, things from the past get brought back around like this in a great way. <br />

Leading into the second portion of Shirogane and Ishigami forced into helping Shijo out with her problem of loving her best friend&#039;s man. Her constant going back and forth emotions were so funny. This is where Shirogane past advice bites him. That wall slam move has Ser Kashiwagi up with her boyfriend nicely but has sent Shijo down a spiral. She loves that boy for whatever reason and is determined now to steal him. The last portion with the coin game was kinda fun. Kaguya of course tried to outsmart the whole thing but to no avail. Shirogane protecting his anonymity.

"Nagisa Kashiwagi wants advise to kill her boyfriend whom cheated on her, and seeking both Kaguya and Iino&#039;s help on this. Unfortunately, asking Kaguya on this is just crossing her romance lines, and requesting Iino isn&#039;t gonna make the equation better. Going as for as to hire a private detective to stalk their movements, it&#039;s all karma to come back to bite them at their past activities. Eventually Nagisa has to face the music, and all the boyfriend took was another girl&#039;s advice to get a necklace for her.

Maki Shijo, the girl that helped Nagisa&#039;s boyfriend got the anniversary gift for her, the 2nd distant cousin of Kaguya&#039;s clearly jealous, and both Shirogane and Ishigami took notice to console her to give another round of romance advice.

This episode also nice as always, every scene is very enjoyable, Tanuba and Kashiwagi couple is back! Lol for today her boyfriend is cheating but end up with misunderstanding, normal thing that will happened on every couple. I like the scene Iino listening to sus stuff to get her calm, and also the scene where Kaguya can&#039;t accept the reality that Karaokae place is actually a place where couple doing something sus. Last thing, me for the first time seeing they two(Tanuba &amp; Kashiwagi) doing a instense kiss, for a long time, like that everyone blushes for that.<br />

Shijou? She is familiar but I guess this is her first appearance in this series, she is Shinomiya&#039;s family? But I saw in myanimelist, she doesn&#039;t have the Shinomiya family name on her name. Ah yes, triangle love, I know she is just shy to confess to him or she know that he gonna reject automatically because he has a girlfriend. Lol, she is too confident also.

"Some funny comparisons of Shinomiya and Iino handing love advise vs Shirogane and Ishigami. Nagisa&#039;s character sure has expanded and her over complications of certain events with her bf makes me worry about his safety, but what was also concerning was how Shinomiya was on the same wave length as her 90% of the time. I did find Iino curling into a ball and putting on her &quot;[i]comfort playlist[/i]&quot; while they made it out like she was the weird one quite funny. Although Nagisa is most definitely a red flag in more then one place, but red is my favourite colour so fair play to her bf.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the spectrum Shirogane and Ishigami consulate Maki who seems to swing moods faster then a pendulum. Maki faces the issue of a rivalry for Nagisa&#039;s boyfriend, puts both the poor lads into a state of chaos, guilt trips Shirogane to thinking he was the cause for teaching Nagisa&#039;s boyfriend the &quot;[i]wall slam[/i]&quot; move, then decides she&#039;ll steal him instead. Honestly i feel like if you managed to steal Nagisa&#039;s bf and make it out both alive thats an achievement in itself. <br />
Either way i feel like the entire council lost in some way after witnessing Nagisa and her boyfriend make out.<br />

"This show is too funny. My sides. Help.<br />
<br />
What makes this show so great is that without all of the comedy, there&#039;re great messages and references to real life interactions, thoughts, anxieties and quirks. Some that many won&#039;t probably admit, but because it&#039;s laid out in the open in the funniest scenarios, it makes it all so much more enjoyable to laugh at. <br />
<br />
The direction is also god-tier. In the beginning of this episode, it references back to a time when Shirogane took all sorts of training from Fujiwara, and Kaguya can&#039;t help but think of her &#039;evil influence&#039; when Nagisa claims that Tsubasa is taking tutelage from Maki. Then it cuts to Fujiwara training Shirogane to rap. He&#039;s wearing a red hoodie and all he&#039;s doing is say &#039;yo yo yo.&#039; Referencing another joke that he can&#039;t fking rap. <br />
<br />
This show is so genius, I can&#039;t believe it. So many beautiful misunderstandings and so many equally beautiful revelations. <br />
<br />
This season so far has taken the whole concept of the show to the next level. I can&#039;t think of a more satisfying romcom.

"NTR-chan is here, let&#039;s gooooo!",ntr chan let 039 gooooo!
"Never underestimate the yandere switch being flipped on. Poor Miko had a rough time listening to Nagisa&#039;s rantings, in which Kaguya agreed to readily on almost everything she said, about how her boyfriend was cheating on her with Miko. Thankfully, that wasn&#039;t the case and with that, she french kissed him in front of the entire student council. Their reactions were hilarious! XD<br />
<br />
Maki, on the other hand, is a cute, but serious tsundere who DOES have feelings for Nagisa&#039;s boyfriend, which was made apparent during her talk with Miyuki and Ishigami. Not just that, but she&#039;s related to Kaguya and their little talk was filled to the brim with tension. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll see more of Maki sooner or later.<br />
<br />
The ten-yen game was the best part of the episode. Chika was in her element with getting everyone involved with the game and how honest they would answer to the questions, although it didn&#039;t stop both Kaguya and Miyuki from trying to rig the game to their advantage. As for me, I loved Miko&#039;s wholesome reaction to when everyone rallied around her and reassured her that she wasn&#039;t annoying and that they all like her. =3<br />

I guess there was something like that, the truth is, they skip soo much already, if this was a normal adaptation, and they took 3 chapters per episode, then we should not be around chapter 81-82, far into what S2 did, and there is no way S3 would ever reach chapter 136.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they dont skip that much from now on, that was always my major complain with the adaptation, and while not all chapters are born equally, all deserve some love, thus I would like to see OVAs covering all chapters that were skipped (in a dream world)!<br />

Iino can barely muster anything remotely positive about Ishigami its hilarious. Ishigami meanwhile does somewhat admire Iino but not to any significant extent. At least that&#039;s how it is on the surface for them both. I think that Osaragi is closer to the truth than she realizes, or that Iino and Ishigami realize. Shirogane kinda became the punching bag this episode, as he tends to be. First his plan to help Iino and Ishigami goes down in flames but then he&#039;s sabotaged at karaoke by Hayasaka. Kaguya laying down the ultimate guilt trip on Hayasaka to follow Shirogane on the group date. Hayasaka playing the role well but Shirogane does cut to the core of the matter being able to tell Hayasaka is acting a part.

Not the best Kaguya-sama episode but it was a good one and a significant improvement enjoyment-wise for me from the first one. Hayasaka was the star of the episode too imo. She actually sang well and I would lowkey listen to it a few times, even with the cheesy, depressing lyrics displaying her &#039;emotions&#039;. The first segment with forcing Ishigami and Miko to bond with each other was nice too, way better than the earphones segment last time. Osaragi&#039;s something else there.

"Shows with episodic formula are more likely to not be consistent in quality due to a creation of a whole new scenario for the show to delve into it. Which is why I appreciate how not only Kaguya-sama manage to stay consistent, but the quality we&#039;re talking about is above anything else of its genre. <br />
It&#039;s also amazing how it creates interesting drama scenarios that hook you in seconds, like the whole question about you puttin on an act.

"The [b]Friendship[/b] and [b]Mixer/Karaoke[/b] chapters are pretty good, these two chapters are ones I vividly remember after finishing Season 2 and subsequently reading the manga. And seeing them adapted makes me feel that the rest of the chapters allocated to this season will be improved and adapted properly in more ways than one!<br />
<br />
Miko and Ishigami trying to even stay at each other&#039;s throats is so funny, it&#039;s unreal how they storyboarded these scenes where I can&#039;t even believe that some cuts are even seen in the manga. But that karaoke scene is the one that gave me the most fun. Hayasaka!!! yes she is the MVP of this episode,  and for most of the time that she&#039;s on the screen, it&#039;s basically Attack on Kaguya-sama and Shirogane. Some of the lines she says are downright savage, and for a moment she does not give a fuck to her master. Cherry on top though is when Kaguya misunderstood the things she heard in the room, and I just cackled. Finally, when Chika arrived and she heard that Shirogane&#039;s singing is trash, yeah those flashbacks are still haunting her. But don&#039;t worry, he will come back for another training arc, I can&#039;t wait to hear some dondayo rapping again next episode.<br />

This Ep was a masterpiece like Ep1, I laughed so hard as always(laughed so hard silently cuz it&#039;s embarrassing to laugh loudly in public).<br />
<br />
So, about the first scene, I like both Ishigami and Iino relationship, yeah it&#039;s funny af, they maybe hate each other, but they are so familiar with each other. First attempt, fail. Second attempt , fail. Third attempt, fail. Ahaha the last one, aww kawaii, they confess each other, with no romance but bot/fake 100%.<br />
<br />
Second scene/last scene! Woah!! Hayasaka moment! I like this new mission(maybe), it&#039;s about karaoke. Love Shirogane and Hayasaka act like holy sh this funny af. Okay they went to the karaoke place, yeah that sus place. I like the drama ahaha, kaguya start worried and lol. Kaguya spy them with sus clothing and hear like, Dame! It&#039;s to big! Ahh~!, ikr everyone expect Kaguya think they doing something very sus, nice misunderstanding. When Kaguya enters the room, holy tf I thought they doing it for real, and ah yes Shirogane singing moment, Shirogane singing is Fujiwara&#039;s Nightmare or I can say that is her phobia moment.<br />

"[b]Shirogane, Ishigami and Osaragi&#039;s meditation section about Iino, hark, put these two together already for their love betrothed from hatred.[/b]<br />
<br />
Though this is the first time that both Shirogane and Osaragi first met, the idea of reconciliation for both Iino and Ishigami is important, what Shirogane came up with was met with absurd criticism lols. From giving compliments to ear cleaning, all the activities being couple-like isn&#039;t working out. [b]It really is Osaragi&#039;s victory.[/b]<br />
<br />
Shirogane&#039;s &quot;networking&quot; activity of karaoke, and Kaguya is OK with it, except if it&#039;s a group date as Hayasaka presumed. And since Kaguya hit a snag on her, Hayasaka going in her stead to shield Shirogane from other girls (which looks like a field of only guys and few girls) is a wild joke that impresses as she should. And the role-reversal play of Shirogane, now that&#039;s a gentleman.<br />
<br />
But what happens afterward...probably is the best joke of the episode as both Hayasaka and Shirogane had their own private karaoke session, the ultimate betrayal of the century for making a seducting steal. And who else than to bring for a karaoke session than Chika, that unfortunately Hayasaka is the 2nd person to experience Shirogane&#039;s bad singing, which triggered Chika&#039;s PTSD from last time, all that effort (in Season 2) was for nothing.<br />

"what an emotional rollercoaster of only a second episode. Getting more Ishigami and Iino duo scenes is always great. Some pretty interesting Iino backstory shown with  how she had been covering for Ishigami for already quite some time, even as early as during the massive event that changed Ishigami quite a lot. Even though this duo fight a lot, it&#039;s really nice to see them together no matter how hard it is to get them to co-operate. <br />
<br />
Second half was wild, went from me saying &quot;[i]Oh God Hayasaka why would you say that[/i]&quot; to &quot;[i]holy shit more Hayasaka hell fucking yes[/i]&quot; then &quot;[i]wait what[/i]&quot;. Love me some Hayasaka however this time she was dropping some straight facts to Shirogane, even though partially out of spite but arguably having to always be the executer for Kaguya&#039;s plans you gotta give her this one. Kaguya&#039;s screaming once her imagination went wild was hilarious, she was loosing it so much you could hear her Paimon come out. Fujiwara hyperventilating from being reminded of Shirogane&#039;s traumatic singing also got me good.<br />

We found out how Iino covered so much for Ishigami and so they both feel like the other one should be grateful to them, I&#039;m totally shipping these two, looking forward to more developments between these two.<br />

The second part was just amazing. It&#039;s kinda scary how Hayasaka puts up an act as easily as she breathes. Seriosuly, Hayasaka is a scary woman. Also, for a second there I legit thought Hayasaka has fallen for Shirogane and I was like [i]yabai[/i]. <br />

Hayasaka&#039;s singing was really good, wouldn&#039;t mind a full version of that song in her voice.<br />

This episode fell flat. I don&#039;t see how it&#039;s appealing in any way. I miss the days when it was just the student council have ongoing internal competition.

"God... DAMN!!! The OP is ofc undeniably fantastic! As were the previous OPs. Masayuki Suzuki&#039;s vocals are as melodic as always, the upbeat rhythm is so damn catchy, I absolutely love the OP! It&#039;s as classic of an opening for this series as it can get! The ED on the other hand got its fair share of lovely quirks as well. However, I simply want to point out just how much I appreciate the thoughts given to the visuals for the ED. It&#039;s astounding! The ED took on a more unique art style, somewhat movie-like. And a movie it is. The entire ED is essentially a reference to Starship Troopers, and it&#039;s a great ED, especially when coupled with charming vocals and joyful instrumentals. Ahhh, you&#039;d be foolish to skip the OP and the ED of Kaguya Sama Love is War!<br />

Ishigami and Iino are like Water and oil, they never mix well together, but don&#039;t lose hope! Given a certain situation, even the most repellent of particles are able to bond together, take that as you will...<br />

"Why do you feel annoyed just because Ishigami is in the student council room. Somehow I like their silence, at least please insert the wires properly, lol. Don&#039;t make people misunderstand. Why are camels there, lol. I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re listening to, lol... Is it a BL drama, lol. Even Miko still doesn&#039;t notice but yeah, the Ishigami situation... Ishigami really sacrificed for Miko, xD... What a gentleman<br />
<br />
In-School Student Organization members on their way home after nothing happened. Kaguya is really an ojou-sama, no matter how many times I see Kaguya&#039;s house, it&#039;s still amazing. Is this the debut of Line? After Kaguya got the call. Hayasaka and Kaguya&#039;s moment so sweet. What is kidoku? Êó¢Ë™≠ = Read? <br />
<br />
Somehow I felt that the scene when Kaguya received a call from Shirogane sounded erotic, with that sigh. Kaguya has just installed the line and she doesn&#039;t know what Kidoku is, like I do. Shirokane called to explain what Kidoku was but yeah I still don&#039;t seem to understand.<br />
<br />
Dounikashinasai sign makes me lagu, xD... Though it was purely Kaguya&#039;s fault but yeah, Hayasaka managed to cover it up somehow.Fujiwara is very strong compared to Ishigami, lol... Even heavy stuff she can lift, and also she can even lift 2 big mountains.<br />
<br />
Is it with the mouth of someone&#039;s strength that we have to do arm wrestling? Either way it&#039;s a decided tournament, lol. Ishigami vs Kaguya...  What&#039;s up with Kaguya&#039;s right hand, lol... Ma, as a man Ishigami is really going through for Kaguya&#039;s sake, but yeah Kaguya really trained that because of the arrow extracurricular she did, it really was like op 2 and than Shirogane vs Fujiwara...<br />
<br />
And for closing battle, Kaguya vs Shirogane that Was Intense fight, is this a pride fight? For some reason, they are nervous in arm wrestling... Romantic scenes can be done in a fight like this.And that&#039;s what happens when Kaguya gets serious, lol. Kinniku hime? Itnseem like Kaguya happy with those title, xD...<br />

Hayasaka is with her high voice oh god that made Kaguya&rsquo;s face is going real mad ;_; <br />

Oh yes the wrestling segment and I legit thought they were playing the song &ldquo;We will rock you&rdquo; when Kaguya is going against Ishigami and Chika thinks she can win against Ishigami and lmao Ishigami himself is even humiliating her when she&rsquo;s going against Shirogane xDD Poor Chika, better luck next time blob :3 Yay Kaguya won the wrestling against Shirogane but that does give her some romance ambience between her and Shirogane mhm mhm.<br />

<br />
Kaguya&#039;s first experience of using LINE (much less a smartphone) to converse with the others, and what a feeling for Hayasaka to stare at her advances to leave messages read and not replying to parties, just because she didn&#039;t know how it works. The psychological virtual romance battle is just as frenetic as the school life equivalent, and Hayasaka constantly lying and silently keeping mum is such a tease, ending in everyone&#039;s loss.<br />
<br />
OOH fighting girl Chika Fujiwara, and she wants to challenge everyone to arm wrestling to prove her superiority. Ishigami vs. Kaguya for a start, and the archery club girl is just too much for the average weakling. Shirogane vs. Chika, and this is the norm for her to cheat her way though.

"It hasn&#039;t even been that long but I&#039;m so glad this is back already with 3 segments for the week! <br />
<br />
Got to give it to Ishigami in the first despite his vain attempt to prevent embarrassing her. Some of his reactions at the start were precious though, definitely lost my composure when that ikemen voice in Umehara Yuuichiro-san played too. Iino-chan sure loves hearing anything and everything in the name of &quot;healing music&quot; xD. <br />
<br />
And then, going on to save her by taking a bit for the team. How&#039;d Iino-chan not try and confirm to see if things were okay on her end. It&#039;s hilarious that she froze up to the extent that she couldn&#039;t even pause the music, lol. Ishigami-kun&#039;s kyun kyun song was on point too. If you&#039;re going down, don&#039;t hold back. Lesson well learned, Ishigami. <br />
<br />
Back to Kaguya and her inexperience with tech. Line debut, it was about time honestly. Didn&#039;t think it&#039;d circle around the read system but if it&#039;s as good as this, I&#039;ll take it any day. Hayasaka really tried but the lie came back to bite her, lol. For a second, I thought Shirogane had it in the bag but creds to Kaguya for devising that masterful plan out of the blue and turning the cards around. God, please save Shirogane&#039;s soul. That was too close yet so far. Spare a thought for the others too having to get caught up in this 4D psychological battle. <br />
<br />
Arm-wrestling to finish proceedings for the first episode. Chika&#039;s strength impressed me at first but then she got caught red-handed yet again. It&#039;s impressive that she still comes up with such despite her failed attempts so far. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d a feeling Kaguya would be a force to reckon with but to that incredible extent? Well, I&#039;ll be damned. Poor Ishigami got obliterated. Thankfully for him, Fujiwara joined him. <br />
<br />
Sweat avoidance, that&#039;s the [s]downfall[/s] rise of Kaguya-sama. Muscle Queen remarks xD. Imagine being called that by the guy you fancy. My condolences...<br />

"Had a smile on my face this whole episode! Its beyond nice to have Kaguya sama back! I&#039;ve missed this seeing these characters animated. The manga is nice too but the anime elevates it so well with the performances and the visual flair the animators bring. The Kaguya sama anime is handled with immense care. This premiere brought back all the joy of watching the previous seasons those years ago. Jumping right in with Ishigami and Iino struggling with her earphones not being plugged in. Iino has an interesting diverse set of soothing sounds. I went through all the emotions Ishigami did listening to Iino different sounds. First nice ambient noise, then weird camels, then pretty boys with compliments, going from one end of the spectrum and back again. Ishigami did his best to save face for Iino but she still couldn&#039;t get out of her own way. <br />
<br />
Kaguya still doesn&#039;t have a grasp on the ins and outs of how a social media messenger app like Line works. We don&#039;t have that stateside but it seems to work the same as any usual messaging app works. Kaguya with her naivety and inexperience digging a massive hole for herself staring at Shirogane messages for literal hours. Ayasaka being forced to concoct this fake story to save Kaguya. Chika also in the last segment dug herself a hole offering the arm wrestling challenge. Having go cheat and use messed up hand positions to win, so low. Chika couldn&#039;t even beat Ishigami at the very end, proving herself the weakest of the student council. I knew that once Kaguya and Shirogane were the finalists they&#039;d just stay holding hands for as long as possible. The opportunity was too great to pass up. Kaguya ultimately winning after a sweaty hand freak out. Our muscle queen!! Only one episode and we already have a strong comedy of the year candidate",smile face whole episode! beyond nice kaguya sama back! 039 missed seeing characters animated manga nice anime elevates well performances visual flair animators bring kaguya sama anime handled immense care premiere brought back joy watching previous seasons years ago jumping right ishigami iino struggling earphones plugged iino interesting diverse set soothing sounds went emotions ishigami listening iino different sounds first nice ambient noise weird camels pretty boys compliments going one end spectrum back ishigami best save face iino still 039 get way kaguya still 039 grasp ins outs social media messenger app like line works 039 stateside seems work usual messaging app works kaguya naivety inexperience digging massive hole staring shirogane messages literal hours ayasaka forced concoct fake story save kaguya chika also last segment dug hole offering arm wrestling challenge go cheat use messed hand positions win low chika 039 even beat ishigami end proving weakest student council knew kaguya shirogane finalists 039 stay holding hands long possible opportunity great pass kaguya ultimately winning sweaty hand freak muscle queen!! one episode already strong comedy year candidate

Soo good to see Kaguya sama grace us with her presence. Looks like the animosity between Miko and Ishigami will is still in full swing. But man thats quite the variety of soothing music that she has though. About time Kaguya gets a smartphone as well as social networking. That was a nice save from Hayasaka though. Chika really is full of surprises huh. The arm wrestle event sure was fun though. Despite the effort i don&#039;t think Princess Muscle was the kind of title that Kaguya wanted. Overall an excellent opening ep and return to the world of Kaguya. As ever the marriage of comedy with character progression is sublime. ,soo good see kaguya sama grace us presence looks like animosity miko ishigami still full swing man thats quite variety soothing music though time kaguya gets smartphone well social networking nice save hayasaka though chika really full surprises huh arm wrestle event sure fun though despite effort 039 think princess muscle kind title kaguya wanted overall excellent opening ep return world kaguya ever marriage comedy character progression sublime

"I loved this episode! Quick thoughts:<br />
<br />
* The jump in animation quality and production values over S2 is insane (and S2 was already a huge leap over S1)<br />
* I loved the return of the mind game shenanigans, which the last few episodes of S2 (understandably) moved away from<br />
* The cringe comedy in the first two skits was breathtaking work, bravo<br />
* I love that we got to see a lot of every major character - Miko, Ishigami, Chika, Shirogane, Hayasaka, and of course, Kaguya<br />
* No one really &quot;won&quot; in this episode lol, everyone had a hard time (at least Ishigami got a consolation prize when he beat Chika though)<br />
* &quot;Hayasaka lies as naturally as she breathes&quot;, THE MADMEN DID IT (and even gave Chika her own version of it lol)<br />
* Probably my most controversial take here will be that I am not a huge fan of the new OP. Like, I love the visuals a lot, but the song itself feels a bit too low energy. I dunno. Daddy Daddy Do grew on me, maybe this will too, but I didn&#039;t particularly love it<br />

I liked the President&#039;s face when he was being thrown by Kaguya, probably the funniest moment for me. But the headphone joke felt like it dragged on.<br />

My question is, will this get back to what worked in the first season, meaning the love competition between the President and Kaguya. Or will it continue the much less interesting long character story lines that made season 2 fairly mediocre? Guess we&#039;ll find out.<br />

<br />
this one is just so entertaining to watch, and i love the arm wrestling and my fave part, the LINE read part... hahahaha",air first episode one entertaining watch love arm wrestling fave part line read part hahahaha
"It&#039;s hard to believe that it&#039;s been two years since Kaguya-Sama was airing, but I&#039;m very happy to see the series back for season three. This first episode was a great reminder as to why this series is a fan-favourite. =)<br />
<br />
I can easily relate to Miko here when she was listening to her music player while studying. I never fully connected my earphones to my iPod for a long time before I realised it by chance. I was lucky enough to never have anyone point it out to me, so I can only sympathise with her when everyone heard what she was listening to. Bless her... XD<br />
<br />
Kaguya using a smartphone for the first time was pretty cute, although her lack of responding to the other members of the council due to her lack of understanding in how LINE works caused Hayasaka to panic. In the end, when Miyuki called her up and mentioned about it, Hayasaka had to jump in to save Kaguya&#039;s blushes with a convincing lie. Shame that Miko, Ishigami and Chika never got replies, though...<br />
<br />
The arm wrestling segment was my favourite of the episode. Poor Miko took yet another L when Chika destroyed her and mocked Ishigami when he lost to Kaguya, but she got her just desserts when she cheated in her attempt to beat Miyuki. Kaguya and Miyuki&#039;s battle was intense, but the fact that Kaguya was sweating made her panic and thus, she won and became the &quot;muscle princess&quot;. Onegai muscle, anyone? &gt;v&lt;<br />
<br />
What a banger of a first episode to gets things going again. The new OP song was great, too, so I&#039;ll look forward to hearing it every episode from here on out.",039 hard believe 039 two years since kaguya sama airing 039 happy see series back season three first episode great reminder series fan favourite easily relate miko listening music player studying never fully connected earphones ipod long time realised chance lucky enough never anyone point sympathise everyone heard listening bless xd kaguya using smartphone first time pretty cute although lack responding members council due lack understanding line works caused hayasaka panic end miyuki called mentioned hayasaka jump save kaguya 039 blushes convincing lie shame miko ishigami chika never got replies though arm wrestling segment favourite episode poor miko took yet another l chika destroyed mocked ishigami lost kaguya got desserts cheated attempt beat miyuki kaguya miyuki 039 battle intense fact kaguya sweating made panic thus became quot muscle princess quot onegai muscle anyone gt v lt banger first episode gets things going new op song great 039 look forward hearing every episode

Got a suspicion they aren&#039;t gonna do any more anime seasons after this one given that the manga would be over by the time it&#039;d even get one so its lost that thing to advertise, but at least the anime is gonna end on the strongest part of the series even though I do love alot of the stuff that comes after and would hope it can somehow see the light of day in anime form.

I kept thinking, I shoulda known they were gonna have prez and kaguya as the main battlers, even though they weren&#039;t at the forefront of that last segment but i was like, they always do a loser battle to when its only like 4-5 peeps - and then when the credits rolled, i was a bit disappointed till it flipped back on<br />

"Ahh so we have arrived at yet another season of this series, season 3 to be exact. And we jump straight into the meat of the story from the get go!<br />

There&#039;s already no doubt of how chad-like Ishigami is, he is the embodiment of unsung heroes as he helps those in need before they even expect it all without any desire to be rewarded back. The sacrifices he made may not all be noticed, but he who stands at the pinnacle of manliness holds the crown and the title of an absolute legend for all the good deeds he has contributed for the sake of his friends. What a man he is. On the other hand, despite Ishigami&#039;s effort, Iino&#039;s blind perspective clouded her rational thought, and for that, her foolishness instantly bit her back in the form of public embarrassment, lol.<br />
<br />
Back at it with the romantic exchange between Miyuki and Kaguya, while the rest tries to win in the arm-wrestling match, these two are simply enjoying grasping each others&#039; hands in delight. All until Kaguya began to sweat. <br />
